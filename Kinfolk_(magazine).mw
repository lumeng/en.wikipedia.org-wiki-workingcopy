== The magazine ==
''Kinfolk'' was created by Nathan Williams, his wife Katie Searle-Williams and their friends Doug and Paige Bischoff in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alexandra Zeigler |url=http://www.weldonowen.com/blog/kinfolk-magazines-creator-nathan-williams-inspiration-small-gatherings-and-creative-process|title=Kinfolk magazine's creator Nathan Williams on inspiration, small gatherings, and the creative process|work=Weldon Owen|date=28 May 2012|accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=20 independent magazines that every creative should have on their coffee table|url=http://www.creativeboom.com/resources/20-independent-magazines-that-every-creative-should-have-on-their-coffee-table/|accessdate=23 August 2016|work=Creative Boom|date=9 November 2015}}</ref> Primarily a lifestyle magazine aimed at young professionals, it focuses on home, work, play, food and community through photo essays, recipes, interviews, profiles, personal stories and practical tips. The writers, photographers, designers and chefs who contribute to ''Kinfolk'' are drawn from a largely international pool of creative people, often featuring more than 50 individual contributors an issue.

Released quarterly, each issue is themed around a topic that is related to the season it is being published in, with all food, entertaining and lifestyle content geared towards that theme. Sample articles include interviews with well-known chefs,<ref>{{cite web|last1=O'Hara|first1=Gail|title=An Interview with Andy Ricker from Pok Pok|url=http://www.kinfolk.com/interview-andy-ricker-pok-pok/|website=Kinfolk|accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref> sample themed menus with accompanying recipes, illustrated guides to daily encounters and inspirational photo essays encouraging readers to try new activities.

In addition to its print publication, ''Kinfolk'' organizes monthly "community gathering" events that take place around the world, each based on a seasonal theme such as flower potlucks, butcher's block parties and campfire cooking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://the189.com/lifestyle/kinfolk-dinner-brooklyn-new-york-short-film/|title=Kinfolk Dinner â€“ Brooklyn, New York Short Film &#124; OEN |work=The189.com|date=5 March 2012|accessdate=22 September 2013}}</ref> These events take place concurrently and aim to unite the global community of ''Kinfolk'' readers while also offering practical advice and lessons.
