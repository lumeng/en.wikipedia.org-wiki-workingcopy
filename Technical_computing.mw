'''Technical computing''' is the application of the mathematical and computational principles of [[scientific computing]] to solve practical problems of industrial interest.  The distinction between technical computing and scientific computing is similar to the distinction between [[high-performance computing]] and [[high-performance technical computing]].  Technical computing may involve the use of large-scale high-performance [[supercomputer]]s, but in most cases, the technical problems may be solvable using modern [[laptop]]s or small [[Server (computing)|servers]].
