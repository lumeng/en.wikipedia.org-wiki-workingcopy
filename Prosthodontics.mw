'''Prosthodontics''', also known as '''dental prosthetics''' or '''prosthetic dentistry''', is the area of [[dentistry]] that focuses on [[dental prosthesis|dental prostheses]]. It is one of nine [[specialty (dentistry)|dental specialties]] recognized by the [[American Dental Association]] (ADA), [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]], [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]], [[Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland]], [[Royal College of Surgeons of Glasgow]], [[Royal College of Dentists of Canada]], and [[Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons]]. The ADA defines it as "the dental specialty pertaining to the diagnosis, treatment planning, rehabilitation and maintenance of the oral function, comfort, appearance and health of patients with clinical conditions associated with [[edentulism|missing or deficient teeth and/or oral and maxillofacial tissues]] using [[biocompatibility|biocompatible]] substitutes."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.org/en/education-careers/careers-in-dentistry/dental-specialties/specialty-definitions|title=Specialty Definitions: Definitions of Recognized Dental Specialties|author=American Dental Association}}</ref>

== Training ==
According to the [[American College of Prosthodontists]], a prosthodontist is a dentist who:<ref name=prosthodontics.org>{{cite web|url=http://www.prosthodontics.org|title=American College of Prosthodontists}}</ref>
# Specializes in the aesthetic (cosmetic) restoration and replacement of teeth.
# Receives three to four years of additional training after dental school.
# Restores optimum appearance and function to your smile. The planning, surgical placement and restoration of [[dental implant|implants]] and rehabilitation of [[Occlusion (dentistry)|occlusion]] with prostheses all fall under the field of prosthodontics.

The American College of Prosthodontists (ACP)<ref name=prosthodontics.org /> ensures standards are maintained in the field. Becoming a prosthodontist requires an additional three years of postgraduate specialty training after obtaining a [[dental degree]]. Recently, the ADA's Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) passed the updated educational standards for all prosthodontics programs in the United States that now mandates surgical placement of dental implants at an in-depth competency level (on par with other surgical dental specialties)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.org/en/coda/current-accreditation-standards/|title=Current Accreditation Standards|publisher=Commission on Dental Accreditation}}</ref> Training consists of rigorous clinical and didactic preparation in the basic sciences, [[head and neck anatomy]], biomedical sciences, biomaterial sciences, implant surgery, function of occlusion (bite), TMJ, and treatment planning and experience treating full-mouth reconstruction cases, and esthetics. Due to this extensive training, prosthodontists are required to treat complex cases, full-mouth rehabilitation, TMJ-related disorders, [[congenital disorders]], and [[sleep apnea]] by planning and fabricating various prostheses.  There are only 3,200 prosthodontists in comparison to 170,000 general dentists in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prosthodontics.org/educators/careers.asp|title=Careers and Wages|work=American College of Prosthodontists}}</ref> Prosthodontists have been consistently ranked at 6th or 7th positions by Forbes among America's most competitive and highest salaried jobs.<ref name=forbes09>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/05/04/america-best-paying-leadership-careers-jobs-slide.html | work=Forbes | title=In Pictures: America's Best-Paying Jobs| first=Klaus | last=Kneale|date=4 May 2009}}</ref><ref name=orgrpts>{{cite web |url=http://www.prosthodontics.org/UserFiles/File/Prosthodontic%20Forum%20Organization%20Reports%20November%202007.pdf |title=Prosthodontic Forum Organization Reports November 2007 |format=pdf |date=November 2007 |work=American College of Prosthodontists |accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref><ref name=forbes08>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/07/11/most-competitive-jobs-lead-careers-cx_tw_0711jobs_slide.html | work=Forbes | first=Tara | last=Weiss | title=By The Numbers: America's Most Competitive Jobs|date=11 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Prosthodontist Salary|url=http://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Prosthodontist/Salary|publisher=PayScale|accessdate=4 June 2010}}</ref>

Board certification is awarded through the American Board of Prosthodontics (ABP)<ref>{{cite web|title= American Board of Prosthodontics |url=http://www.prosthodontics.org/abp}}</ref> and requires successful completion of the Part I written examination and Part 2, 3 and 4 oral examinations. The written and one oral examination may be taken during the 3rd year of speciality training and the remaining two oral examinations taken following completion of speciality training. Board eligibility starts when an application is approved by the ABP and lasts for six years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prosthodontics.org/UserFiles/File/ABP%20Feb%2020%202008%20Guidelines%20for%20Certification.pdf |title=Guidelines for the Certification Process |format=pdf |date=20 February 2008 |work=American Board of Prosthodontics |accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref> Diplomates of the ABP are ethically required to have a practice limited to prosthodontics. Fellows of the American College of Prosthodontists (FACP) are required to have a dental degree, have completed three years of prosthodontic speciality training, and be board certified by the ABP.

According to the ADA, specialties are recognized in those areas where advanced knowledge and skills are essential to maintain or restore oral health (Principles of Ethics and Code of Professional Conduct). Not all areas in dentistry will satisfy the requirements for specialty recognition. Acknowledged by the profession, the contributions of such and their endeavors are encouraged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.org/prof/ed/specialties/index.asp|work=American Dental Association|title=Dental Specialties}}</ref>

The American Dental Association does not recognize [[Cosmetic dentistry]] as a speciality.<ref name=Maihofer>{{cite journal |author=Maihofer MG |title=Cosmetic dentistry is not a recognized specialty |journal=The Journal of the Michigan Dental Association |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=18 |date=February 2009  |pmid=19288658}}</ref> Prosthodontics is the only dental speciality under which the concentration of cosmetic/esthetic dentistry falls.<ref name=ADA>{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.org|title=American Dental Association}}</ref> General dentists may perform some simple cosmetic procedures. Consequently, there are questions regarding whether it is ethical for general dentists to treat "smile makeovers" or complex cosmetic and full-mouth reconstruction cases, as they are not qualified to address the complex needs of the patient.<ref name=Maihofer /><ref>{{cite journal |author=Felton DA |title=Ethics, dentistry, and the prosthodontist |journal=Journal of Prosthodontics |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=291 |date=June 2009  |pmid=19635064 |doi=10.1111/j.1532-849X.2009.00484.x}}</ref> Likewise, there is no specialty recognized by the ADA for dental implants.

== Maxillofacial prosthodontics/prosthetics ==
Maxillofacial prosthetics (Oral and Maxillofacial Prosthodontics) is a sub-specialty (or super-specialty) of Prosthodontics.<ref>http://www.ada.org/6429.aspx{{full|date=January 2015}}</ref> All Maxillofacial prosthodontists are prosthodontists first and then attain a fellowship training (1 year) exclusively in Maxillofacial prosthetics that includes oral surgical and prosthodontic treatments.<ref name=ADA /><ref name="maxillofacialprosth1">{{cite web|url=https://www.maxillofacialprosth.org/ReferringPhysicians/WhatisMP.html|work= American Academy of Maxillofacial Prosthetics |title=Referring Physicians}}</ref> Maxillofacial prosthodontists treat patients who have acquired and [[congenital]] defects of the [[head and neck]] (maxillofacial) region due to cancer, surgery, trauma, and/or birth defects. [[Palatal obturator|Maxillary obturators]], speech-aid prosthesis (formerly called as Pharyngeal/soft palate obturators) and mandibular-resection prostheses are the most common prostheses planned and fabricated by Maxillofacial prosthodontists.<ref name="maxillofacialprosth1"/> Other types of prostheses include artificial eyes, nose and other facial prostheses fabricated in conjunction with an [[anaplastologist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.maxillofacialprosth.org/Patients/PatientEd_FP.html|work= American Academy of Maxillofacial Prosthetics |title=Patient Resources}}</ref>

Treatment is multidisciplinary, involving oral and maxillofacial surgeons, plastic surgeons, head and neck surgeons, ENT doctors, oncologists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and other healthcare professionals.
