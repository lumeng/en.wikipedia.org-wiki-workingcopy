Two contradicting theories exist to explain the origins of conjoined twins. The more generally accepted theory is ''fission'', in which the fertilized egg splits partially.<ref name=embryology>{{cite journal|title=The embryology of conjoined twins (Aug. 2004)|journal=Child's Nervous System|volume=20|number=8-9|pages=508–525|pmid=15278382 |doi=10.1007/s00381-004-0985-4|date=Aug 2004|author=Kaufman MH}}</ref> The other theory, no longer believed to be the basis of conjoined twinning,<ref name=embryology/> is fusion, in which a fertilized egg completely separates, but [[stem cell]]s (which search for similar cells) find like-stem cells on the other twin and fuse the twins together. Conjoined twins share a single common [[chorion]], [[placenta]], and [[amniotic sac]], although these characteristics are not exclusive to conjoined twins as there are some monozygotic but non-conjoined twins who also share these structures in utero.<ref>

The most famous pair of conjoined twins was [[Chang and Eng Bunker]] (Thai: อิน-จัน, In-Chan) (1811&ndash;1874), [[Thailand|Thai]] brothers born in Siam, now [[Thailand]]. They traveled with [[P.T. Barnum]]'s circus for many years and were labeled as the '''Siamese twins'''. Chang and Eng were joined by a band of flesh, cartilage, and their fused livers at the torso. In modern times, they could have been easily separated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A369434 |title=h2g2 - Twins - A369434 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03}}</ref>  Due to the brothers' fame and the rarity of the condition, the term "Siamese twins" came to be used as a [[synonym]] for conjoined twins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/conjoined_twins/facts.htm|title=Conjoined Twins |date=January 8, 2010|publisher=University of Maryland Medical Center|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}</ref>

== {{anchor|Types of conjoined twin}}Types ==
Conjoined twins are typically classified by the point at which their bodies are joined. The most common types of conjoined twins are:
* '''Thoraco-omphalopagus''' (28% of cases):<ref name=embryology/> Two bodies fused from the upper chest to the lower chest. These twins usually share a heart, and may also share the [[liver]] or part of the [[digestive system]].<ref name=duplicata>[http://www.thefetus.net/page.php?id=1494 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819191053/http://www.thefetus.net/page.php?id=1494 |date=August 19, 2009 }}</ref>
* '''Thoracopagus''' (18.5%):<ref name=embryology/> Two bodies fused from the upper [[thorax]] to lower belly. The [[heart]] is always involved in these cases.<ref name=duplicata/> As of 2015, separation of a genuinely shared heart has not offered survival to two twins; a designated twin may survive if allotted the heart, sacrificing the other twin.
* '''Omphalopagus''' (10%):<ref name=embryology/>  Two bodies fused at the lower abdomen. Unlike thoracopagus, the heart is never involved in these cases; however, the twins often share a [[liver]], [[digestive system]], [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] and other organs.<ref name=duplicata/>
* '''[[Parasitic twins]]''' (10%):<ref name=embryology/> Twins that are asymmetrically conjoined, resulting in one twin that is small, less formed, and dependent on the larger twin for survival.
* '''[[Craniopagus twins|Craniopagus]]''' (6%):<ref name=embryology/> Fused [[human skull|skull]]s, but separate bodies. These twins can be conjoined at the back of the head, the front of the head, or the side of the head, but not on the face or the base of the skull.<ref name=duplicata/>

Other less-common types of conjoined twins include:
* '''Cephalopagus''': Two faces on opposite sides of a single, conjoined head; the upper portion of the body is fused while the bottom portions are separate. These twins generally cannot survive due to severe malformations of the brain. Also known as janiceps (after the two-faced god [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]]) or syncephalus.<ref name=duplicata/>
* '''Syncephalus''': One head with a single face but four ears, and two bodies.<ref name=duplicata/>
* '''Cephalothoracopagus''': Bodies fused in the head and thorax. In this type of twins, there are two faces facing in opposite directions, or sometimes a single face and an enlarged skull.<ref name=duplicata/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collphyphil.org/virt_tour/museum_8.htm |title=www.collphyphil.org |publisher=www.collphyphil.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815054642/http://www.collphyphil.org/virt_tour/museum_8.htm |archivedate=2010-08-15 |df= }}</ref>
* '''Xiphopagus''': Two bodies fused in the [[Xyphoid process|xiphoid cartilage]], which is approximately from the navel to the lower breastbone. These twins almost never share any vital organs, with the exception of the liver.<ref name=duplicata/> A famous example is [[Chang and Eng Bunker]].
* '''[[Ischiopagi|Ischiopagus]]''': Fused lower half of the two bodies, with [[Vertebral column|spines]] conjoined end-to-end at a 180° angle. These twins have four arms; one, two, three or four legs; and typically one external set of [[genitalia]] and [[anus]].<ref name=duplicata/>
* '''Omphalo-Ischiopagus''': Fused in a similar fashion as ischiopagus twins, but facing each other with a joined abdomen akin to omphalopagus. These twins have four arms, and two, three, or four legs.<ref name=duplicata/>
* '''Parapagus''': Fused side-by-side with a shared [[human pelvis|pelvis]]. Twins that are '''dithoracic parapagus''' are fused at the abdomen and pelvis, but not the thorax. Twins that are '''[[diprosopic parapagus]]''' have one trunk and two faces. Twins that are '''[[dicephalic parapagus]]''' have one trunk and two heads, and have two (dibrachius), three (tribrachius), or four (tetrabrachius) arms.<ref name=duplicata/>
* '''[[Craniopagus parasiticus]]''': Like craniopagus, but with a second bodiless head attached to the dominant head.
* '''Pygopagus (Iliopagus)''': Two bodies joined at the [[human pelvis|pelvis]].<ref name=duplicata/>
* '''Rachipagus''': Twins joined along the dorsal aspect (back) of their bodies, with fusion of the vertebral arches and the soft tissue from the head to the buttocks<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 8711621| year = 1995| author1 = Spencer| first1 = R| title = Rachipagus conjoined twins: They really do occur!| journal = Teratology| volume = 52| issue = 6| pages = 346–56| doi = 10.1002/tera.1420520605}}</ref>

== Causes ==
Embryo splitting in which [[zygote]] divide asexually,
to produce identical children, is blocked by [[Mitotic inhibitor|mitosis inhibitor]].

==Management==
===Separation===
Surgery to separate conjoined twins may range from very easy to very difficult depending on the point of attachment and the internal parts that are shared. Most cases of separation are extremely risky and life-threatening. In many cases, the surgery results in the death of one or both of the twins, particularly if they are joined at the head or share a vital organ. This makes the [[ethics]] of surgical separation, where the twins can survive if not separated, contentious. [[Alice Dreger]] of [[Northwestern University]] found the quality of life of twins who remain conjoined to be higher than is commonly supposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674018257 |title=One of Us: Conjoined Twins and the Future of Normal: Alice Domurat Dreger: 9780674018259: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03}}</ref> [[Lori and George Schappell]] and [[Abby and Brittany Hensel]] are notable examples.

In 1955, neurosurgeon Harold Voris (1902-1980)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://photoarchive.lib.uchicago.edu/db.xqy?one=apf1-08520.xml|title=Voris, Harold C.|publisher=The University of Chicago Photographic Archive|date=1972|accessdate=2017-07-30}}</ref> and his team at [[Mercy Hospital and Medical Center|Mercy Hospital]] in Chicago performed the first successful operation to separate Siamese twins conjoined ([[Craniopagus twins]]) at the head, which resulted in long-term survival for both.<ref>{{cite journal|title= The craniopagus malformation: classification and implications for surgical separation|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/129/5/1084|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=April 5, 2006|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercy-chicago.org/mercy-firsts|title=Mercy Firsts|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Seaparate Siamese Twins!|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1955/04/22/page/1/article/separate-siamese-twins|date=April 22, 1955|accessdate=October 14, 2015|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref> The larger girl was reported in 1963 as developing normally, but the smaller was permanently impaired.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Cranioplasty in a Craniopagus Twin|url=http://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/jns.1963.20.2.0145?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed|first=Harold C. |last=Voris| journal=Journal of Neurosurgery |date=February 1963|volume=20| issue=2|pages=145–147|doi=10.3171/jns.1963.20.2.0145|pmid=14192083}}</ref>

In 1957, Bertram Katz and his surgical team made international medical history performing the world's first successful separation of conjoined twins sharing a vital organ.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www4.vindy.com/extra/tributes/905419781.html |title=Dr. Bewrtram Katz, 83 - Obituary |publisher=4.vindy.com |accessdate=2014-08-03}}</ref> Omphalopagus twins John Nelson and James Edward Freeman (Johnny and Jimmy) were born to Mr. and Mrs. William Freeman of Youngstown, Ohio, on April 27, 1956.

The operation was funded by the Ohio Crippled Children's Service Society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twinstuff.com/component/content/article/26-twin-facts/119-conjoined-twins-1950s?directory=27 |accessdate=April 11, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Recent successful separations of conjoined twins include that of the separation of [[Ganga & Jamuna Shreshta]] in 2001, who were born in [[Kathmandu, Nepal]], in 2000. The 197-hour surgery on the pair of [[craniopagus twins]] was a landmark one which took place in [[Singapore]]; the team was led by neurosurgeons Chumpon Chan and Keith Goh.<ref>{{cite news  |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna/analysis_prog/incon/incon_doc2.htm  |work=Channel News Asia Singapore  |title=In Conversation with Medicine's Miracle Workers -- Dr Chumpon Chan and Dr Keith Goh  |date=April 19, 2001  |accessdate=March 27, 2010  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114212842/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna/analysis_prog/incon/incon_doc2.htm  |archivedate=January 14, 2011  |df=  }}</ref> The surgery left Ganga with brain damage and Jamuna unable to walk. Seven years later, Ganga Shrestha died at the Model Hospital in Kathmandu in July 2009, at the age of 8, three days after being admitted for treatment of a severe chest infection.<ref>[http://news.monstersandcritics.com/southasia/news/article_1420406.php/Nepali_twin_dies_7_years_after_97-hour_separation_surgery ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105100206/http://news.monstersandcritics.com/southasia/news/article_1420406.php/Nepali_twin_dies_7_years_after_97-hour_separation_surgery |date=November 5, 2013 }}</ref>

A case of particular interest was that of infants Rose and Grace ("Mary" and "Jodie") Attard, conjoined twins from Malta who were separated in Great Britain by court order [[Re A (Children) (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation)]] over the religious objections of their parents, Michaelangelo and Rina Attard.  The surgery took place in November, 2000, at [[St Mary's Hospital, Manchester|St Mary's Hospital]] in [[Manchester]].  The operation was controversial because Rose, the weaker twin, would die as a result of the procedure as her heart and lungs were dependent upon Grace's.  (The twins were attached at the lower abdomen and spine.)  However, if the operation had not taken place, it was certain that both twins would die.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1292681.stm | work=BBC News | title=Siamese twin Jodie 'to go home soon' | date=April 23, 2001 | accessdate=March 27, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Appel Jacob M | year = 2000 | title = Ethics: English high court orders separation of conjoined twins | url = | journal = Journal of Law Medicine & Ethics | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 312–3 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-720x.2000.tb00678.x}}</ref> Grace survived to enjoy a normal childhood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/We+don%27t+know+how+to+tell+Gracie+her+sister+died+so+she+could+live%3B...-a0166174616 |title=We don't know how to tell Gracie her sister died so she could live; EXCLUSIVE DILEMMA FACING TWINS' PARENTS DAILY Mirror BEST FOR REAL LIFE. - Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03}}</ref>

In 2003 two 29-year-old women from Iran, [[Ladan and Laleh Bijani]], who were joined at the head but had separate brains (craniopagus) were surgically separated in Singapore, despite surgeons' warnings that the operation could be fatal to one or both. Their complex case was accepted only because high tech graphical imagery and modelling would allow the medical team to plan the risky surgery. Unfortunately, an undetected major vein hidden from the scans was discovered during the operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.10/twins_pr.html |title=Wired 11.10: Till Death Do Us Part |publisher=Wired.com |date=2001-04-11 |accessdate=2014-08-03}}</ref> The separation was completed but both women died while still in surgery on July 8, 2003.

In Arabia, the twin brothers [[Hashim ibn Abd Manaf]] and [['Abd Shams]] were born with Hashim's leg attached to his twin brother's head. Legend says that their father, [[Abd Manaf ibn Qusai]], separated his conjoined sons with a sword and that some priests believed that the blood that had flowed between them signified wars between their progeny (confrontations did occur between Banu al'Abbas and Banu Ummaya ibn 'Abd Shams in the year 750 AH).<ref name="pg69">The Life of the Prophet Muhammad: Al-Sira Al-Nabawiyya By Ibn Kathir, Trevor Le Gassick, Muneer Fareed, pg. 132</ref> The [[Muslim]] [[polymath]] [[Abū al-Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]] described conjoined twins in his book ''Kitab-al-Saidana''.<ref name="Zahoor">A.

The English twin sisters [[Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst]], who were conjoined at the back (pygopagus), lived from 1100 to 1134 (or 1500 to 1534) and were perhaps the best-known early historical example of conjoined twins. Other early conjoined twins to attain notice were the "Scottish brothers", allegedly of the [[dicephalus]] type, essentially two heads sharing the same body (1460&ndash;1488, although the dates vary); the pygopagus Helen and  Judith of [[Szőny]], [[Hungary]] (1701&ndash;1723), who enjoyed a brief career in music before being sent to live in a [[convent]]; and Rita and Cristina of Parodi of [[Sardinia]], born in 1829. Rita and Cristina were dicephalus tetrabrachius (one body with four arms) twins and although they died at only eight months of age, they gained much attention as a curiosity when their parents exhibited them in Paris.

[[Image:Bunker Grave.jpg|right|thumb|Grave of Eng and Chang Bunker near [[Mt. Airy, North Carolina]]]]Several sets of conjoined twins lived during the nineteenth century and made careers for themselves in the [[performing arts]], though none achieved quite the same level of fame and fortune as Chang and Eng. Most notably, [[Millie and Christine McCoy]] (or McKoy), pygopagus twins, were born into slavery in North Carolina in 1851. They were sold to a [[showman]], J.P. Smith, at birth, but were soon [[kidnap]]ped by a rival showman. The kidnapper fled to England but was thwarted because England had already banned slavery. Smith traveled to England to collect the girls and brought with him their mother, Monimia, from whom they had been separated. He and his wife provided the twins with an education and taught them to speak five languages, play music, and sing. For the rest of the century the twins enjoyed a successful career as "The Two-Headed Nightingale" and appeared with the Barnum Circus. In 1912 they died of [[tuberculosis]], 17 hours apart.

Giovanni and Giacomo Tocci, from [[Locana]], Italy, were immortalized in [[Mark Twain]]'s short story "Those Extraordinary Twins" as fictitious twins Angelo and Luigi. The Toccis, born in 1877, were dicephalus tetrabrachius twins, having one body with two legs, two heads, and four arms. From birth they were forced by their parents to perform and never learned to walk, as each twin controlled one leg (in modern times [[physical therapy]] allows twins like the Toccis to learn to walk on their own). They are said to have disliked show business. In 1886, after touring the United States, the twins returned to Europe with their family, where they fell very ill. They are believed to have died around this time, though some sources claim they survived until 1940, living in seclusion in Italy.
