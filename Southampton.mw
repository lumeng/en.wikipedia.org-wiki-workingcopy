{{Main|History of Southampton|Timeline of Southampton}}

=== Early Southampton ===
Archaeological finds suggest that the area has been inhabited since the [[stone age]].<ref name=MusArch>Southampton Museum of Archeology. God's House Tower, Southampton.</ref> Following the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43 and the conquering of the local Britons in 70&nbsp;AD the fortress settlement of ''[[Clausentum]]'' was established. It was an important trading port and defensive outpost of Winchester, at the site of modern [[Bitterne Manor]]. ''Clausentum'' was defended by a wall and two ditches and is thought to have contained a bath house.<ref>Southampton Through the Ages: A Short History by Elsie M. Sandell (revised 1980)</ref>  ''Clausentum'' was not [[End of Roman rule in Britain|abandoned]] until around 410.<ref name=MusArch/>

The [[Anglo-Saxons]] formed a new, larger, settlement across the [[River Itchen, Hampshire|Itchen]] centred on what is now the [[St Mary's, Southampton|St Mary's]] area of the city. The settlement was known as ''Hamwic'',<ref name=MusArch/> which evolved into ''Hamtun'' and then ''Hampton''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba66/feat3.shtml |accessdate=19 October 2009

Viking raids from 840 onwards contributed to the decline of Hamwic in the 9th century,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/s-leisure/artsheritage/museums-galleries/ghtower-museumofarchaeology/saxon.aspx|accessdate =19 October 2009|author=Southampton City Council|title = Saxon Southampton}}</ref> and by the 10th century a fortified settlement, which became medieval Southampton, had been established.<ref name="sotongovmedieval">{{cite web |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/s-leisure/artsheritage/museums-galleries/ghtower-museumofarchaeology/medieval.aspx|accessdate=19 October 2009|author=Southampton City Council|title=Medieval Southampton}}</ref>

=== 11th – 13th century ===
Following the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066, Southampton became the major port of transit between the then capital of England, Winchester, and [[Normandy]].

Ruddock, The Greyfriars in Southampton, Papers & Proceedings of the Hampshire Field Club & Archaeological Society, 16:2 (1946), pp. 137–47</ref> The friars constructed a water supply system in 1290, which carried water from Conduit Head (remnants of which survive near Hill Lane, [[Shirley, Southampton|Shirley]]) some {{convert|1.7|km|1|order=flip}} to the site of the friary inside the town walls.<ref name="Davies">Rev.

Prior to King Henry's departure for the [[Battle of Agincourt]] in 1415, the ringleaders of the "[[Southampton Plot]]"—[[Richard, Earl of Cambridge]], [[Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham]], and Sir [[Thomas Grey (1384-1415)|Thomas Grey of Heton]]—were accused of high treason and tried at what is now the Red Lion public house in the High Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/features/hants_facts/2165774.Red_Lion_plot/|title=Red Lion Plot|date=2 April 2008|accessdate=19 October 2009|author=Southern Daily Echo}}</ref> They were found guilty and summarily executed outside the [[Bargate]].<ref name="RancePP48">{{cite book|title=Southampton.

On the other hand, many of the medieval buildings once situated within the town walls are now in ruins or have disappeared altogether.

In his 1854 book "The Cruise of the Steam Yacht North Star" John Choules described Southampton thus: "I hardly know a town that can show a more beautiful Main Street than Southampton, except it be Oxford.  The High Street opens from the quay, and under various names it winds in a gently sweeping line for one mile and a half, and is of very handsome width.  The variety of style and color of material in the buildings affords an exhibition of outline, light and color, that I think is seldom equalled.  The shops are very elegant, and the streets are kept exceedingly clean."

==Governance==
[[File:Southampton-CivicCentre-West.jpg|thumb|left|[[Southampton Civic Centre]]]]

After the establishment of Hampshire County Council, following the act in 1888, Southampton became a [[county borough]] within the [[counties of England|county]] of [[Hampshire]], which meant that it had many features of a county, but governance was now shared between the Corporation in Southampton and the new county council. There is a great source of confusion in the fact that the ancient shire county, along with its associated assizes, was known as the ''County of Southampton''<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate =21 September 2007|year = 1870|author=John Marius Wilson|title = Southamptonshire|publisher=[[Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales]]}}</ref> This was officially changed to ''Hampshire'' in 1959 although the county had been commonly known as Hampshire or Hantscire for centuries. Southampton became a [[non-metropolitan district]] in 1974.

Southampton as a Port and city has had a long history of administrative independence of the surrounding County; as far back as the reign of King John the town and its port were removed from the writ of the King's Sheriff in Hampshire and the rights of custom and toll were granted by the King to the burgesses of Southampton over the port of Southampton and the Port of Portsmouth;<ref name="Edwin Welch">Welch E, (1966), "Southampton City Charters", City of Southampton, additional text.</ref> this tax farm was granted for an annual fee of £200 in the charter dated at Orival on 29 June 1199. The definition of the port of Southampton was apparently broader than today and embraced all of the area between Lymington and Langstone. The corporation had resident representatives in Newport, Lymington and Portsmouth.<ref name="British History Online">{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42036 |title=The borough of Southampton: General historical account |editor=William Page |year=1908 |publisher=British History Online |accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref> By a charter of Henry VI, granted on 9 March 1446/7 (25+26 Hen. VI, m. 32), the mayor, bailiffs and burgesses of the towns and ports of Southampton and Portsmouth became a County incorporate and separate from Hampshire.

The status of the town was changed by a later charter of Charles I by at once the formal separation from Portsmouth and the recognition of Southampton as a county, In the charter dated 27 June 1640 the formal title of the town became 'The Town and County of the Town of Southampton'. These charters and Royal Grants, of which there were many, also set out the governance and regulation of the town and port which remained the 'constitution' of the town until the local government organisation of the later Victorian period which from about 1888 saw the setting up of County Councils across England and Wales and including Hampshire County Council who now took on some of the function of Government in Southampton Town. In this regime, The Town and County of the Town of Southampton became once more a county borough with  responsibility for all aspects of local government. On 24 February 1964 the status changed again by a Charter of Elizabeth II, creating the City and County of the City of Southampton.<ref name="SotonCounty">{{London Gazette |issue=43258 |date=28 February 1964 |page=1856 }}</ref>

The city has undergone many changes to its governance over the centuries and once again became administratively independent from Hampshire County as it was made into a [[unitary authority]] in a local government reorganisation on 1 April 1997, a result of the [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|1992 Local Government Act]]. The district remains part of the Hampshire [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]].

[[Southampton City Council]] consists of 48&nbsp;councillors, 3 for each of the 16 wards. [[Southampton local elections|Council elections]] are held in early May for one third of the seats (one councillor for each ward), elected for a four-year term, so there are elections three years out of four. Since the [[Southampton City Council election, 2016|2016 council elections]], the composition of the council is:

==Geography==
The geography of Southampton is influenced by the sea and rivers. The city lies at the northern tip of the [[Southampton Water]], a deep water estuary, which is a [[ria]] formed at the end of the last Ice Age. Here, the rivers Test and Itchen converge.<ref name="southampton260">''The Port of Southampton''L. E. Tavener Economic Geography, Vol. 26, No. 4 (Oct. 1950), pp. 260–73</ref> The Test—which has salt marsh that makes it ideal for salmon fishing<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/river_test__627604pdf|accessdate =28 July 2007|author=Environment Agency|title = The River Test

The city centre is located between the two rivers.

Town Quay is the original public quay, and dates from the 13th century. Today's Eastern Docks were created in the 1830s by land reclamation of the mud flats between the Itchen & Test estuaries. The Western Docks date from the 1930s when the Southern Railway Company commissioned a major land reclamation and dredging programme.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.solentforum.hants.org.uk/othercoast/western_solent_smp.htm#test6|accessdate =28 July 2007|author=The Solent Forum|title = Western Solent and Southampton Water Shoreline Management Plan}}</ref> Most of the material used for reclamation came from dredging of Southampton Water,<ref>{{cite web

Southampton Water has the benefit of a double high tide, with two high tide peaks,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.pol.ac.uk/home/insight/tidefaq.html|accessdate =28 July 2007|author=Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory|title = Tides}}</ref> making the movement of large ships easier.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.southamptonvts.co.uk/|accessdate =28 July 2007|author=Associated British Ports|title = Southampton VTS – ABP Southampton}}</ref> This is not caused as popularly supposed by the presence of the Isle of Wight, but is a function of the shape and depth of the [[English Channel]].

The city lies in the [[Hampshire Basin]], which sits atop chalk beds.<ref name="southampton260"/>

The [[River Test]] runs along the western border of the city, separating it from the [[New Forest]]. There are bridges over the Test from Southampton, including the road and rail bridges at [[Redbridge, Hampshire|Redbridge]] in the south and the [[M27 motorway]] to the north. The [[River Itchen, Hampshire|River Itchen]] runs through the middle of the city and is bridged in several places. The northernmost bridge, and the first to be built,<ref>{{cite book | last = Holt | first = John |author2=Anne Cole  | title = A bend in the River | publisher=Bitterne Local History Society |date=February 1992 | location = Southampton | url = | id = | isbn = }}</ref> is at [[Mansbridge]], where the [[A27 road]] crosses the Itchen. The original bridge is closed to road traffic, but is still standing and open to pedestrians and cyclists. The river is bridged again at [[Swaythling]], where Woodmill Bridge separates the tidal and non tidal sections of the river. Further south is [[Cobden Bridge]] which is notable as it was opened as a free bridge (it was originally named the Cobden Free Bridge), and was never a [[toll bridge]]. Downstream of the Cobden Bridge is the Northam Railway Bridge, then the [[Northam Bridge|Northam Road Bridge]], which was the first major pre-stressed concrete bridge to be constructed in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbdg.org.uk/bridge_history.html|accessdate=11 March 2008|publisher=www.cbdg.org.uk|title=History of Concrete Bridges}}</ref> The southernmost, and newest, bridge on the Itchen is the [[Itchen Bridge]], which is a toll bridge.

===Areas and suburbs===
{{Southampton suburbs map}}
{{See also|Category:Areas of Southampton}}

Southampton is divided into council wards, suburbs, constituencies, ecclesiastical parishes, and other less formal areas. It has a number of parks and green spaces, the largest being the 148&nbsp;hectare [[Southampton Common]],<ref>{{cite web

|author=Southampton City Council|title = The Hawthorns Urban Wildlife Centre}}</ref> on the former site of Southampton Zoo, a paddling pool and several lakes and ponds.

Council estates are in the [[Weston, Hampshire|Weston]], [[Thornhill, Hampshire|Thornhill]] and [[Townhill Park]] districts. The city is ranked 96th most deprived out of all 354 Local Authorities in England.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.southampton.gov.uk/thecouncil/thecity/research/default.asp#0|accessdate =24 July 2007|author=Southampton City Council|title = Research, Information and Statistics
}}</ref>

In the 2006/07, 1,267 residential dwellings were built in the city—the highest number for 15&nbsp;years. Over 94 per cent of these properties were flats.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.southampton.gov.uk/Images/Southampton%20City%20Statistics%20and%20Research%20July%202007_tcm46-182704.pdf|accessdate =24 July 2007|author=Southampton City Council

There are 16 [[Wards of the United Kingdom|Electoral Wards]] in Southampton, each consisting of longer-established neighbourhoods (see below).

Settlements outside the city are sometimes considered suburbs of Southampton, including [[Chartwell Green]], [[Chilworth, Hampshire|Chilworth]], [[Nursling]], [[Rownhams]], [[Totton]], [[Eastleigh]] and [[West End, Hampshire|West End]]. The villages of [[Marchwood]], [[Ashurst, Hampshire|Ashurst]] and [[Hedge End]] may be considered exurbs of Southampton.

===Climate===
As with the rest of the UK, Southampton experiences an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb''). Its southerly, low lying and sheltered location ensures it is among the warmer, sunnier cities in the UK. It has held the record for the highest temperature in the UK for June at {{convert|35.6|C|F}} since 1976.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torro.org.uk/site/maxtemps.php|title=June 1976 maximum|accessdate=21 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Extremes|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/f/Fact_sheet_No._9.pdf|work=Fact Sheets|publisher=Met Office|accessdate=11 March 2012}}</ref>

===Energy===
The centre of Southampton is located above a large hot water [[aquifer]] that provides [[Geothermal energy|geothermal]] power to some of the city's buildings. This energy is processed at a plant in the West Quay region in Southampton city centre, the only [[Geothermal power in the United Kingdom|geothermal power station]] in the UK. The plant provides private electricity for the [[Port of Southampton]] and hot water to the [[Southampton District Energy Scheme]] used by many buildings including the [[Westquay]] shopping centre. In a 2006 survey of carbon emissions in major UK cities conducted by British Gas, Southampton was ranked as being one of the lowest [[carbon emissions|carbon emitting]] cities in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.britishgasnews.co.uk/index.asp?PageID=16&Year=2006&NewsID=686| date = 22 May 2006| author=British Gas News| title = Reading named as the UK's highest CO2 hot spot| accessdate =8 April 2007}}</ref>

Southampton has always been a port, and the docks have long been a major employer in the city. In particular, it is a port for [[cruise ships]]; its heyday was the first half of the 20th century, and in particular the inter-war years, when it handled almost half the passenger traffic of the UK. Today it remains home to luxury cruise ships, as well as being the largest freight port on the Channel coast and fourth largest UK port by tonnage,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/maritime/ports/provportstats2007|title=(DfT) Provisional Port Statistics 2007|publisher=}}</ref> with several [[container (cargo)|container]] terminals. Unlike some other ports, such as [[Liverpool]], London, and [[Bristol]], where industry and docks have largely moved out of the city centres leaving room for redevelopment, Southampton retains much of its inner-city industry. Despite the still active and expanding docklands to the west of the city centre, further enhanced with the opening of a fourth cruise terminal in 2009, parts of the eastern docks have been redeveloped; the [[Ocean Village, Southampton|Ocean Village]] development, which included a local [[marina]] and small entertainment complex, is a good example. Southampton is home to the headquarters of both the [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] and the [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] of the Department for Transport in addition to cruise operator [[Carnival UK]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/Articles/2007/12/12/26148/carnival-uk-signs-for-new-southampton-cruise-terminal.html |title=Carnival UK signs for new Southampton cruise terminal |publisher=TravelWeekly|date=12 December 2007|accessdate=5 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businesssouthampton.com/content/default.asp?PageId=255 |title=Carnival UK |publisher=businesssouthampton.com |accessdate=5 January 2009}}</ref>

During the latter half of the 20th century, a more diverse range of industry also came to the city, including aircraft and car manufacture, cables, electrical engineering products, and petrochemicals. These now exist alongside the city's older industries of the docks, grain milling, and tobacco processing.<ref name="britannica.com"/>

[[University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust]] is one of the city's largest employers. It provides local hospital services to 500,000 people in the Southampton area and specialist regional services to more than 3 million people across the South of England. The Trust owns and manages [[Southampton General Hospital]], the [[Princess Anne Hospital]] and a palliative care service at Countess Mountbatten House, part of the [[Moorgreen Hospital]] site in the village of [[West End, Hampshire|West End]], just outside the city.

Other major employers in the city include [[Ordnance Survey]], the UK's national mapping agency, whose headquarters is located in a new building on the outskirts of the city, opened in February 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Duke of Edinburgh to officially open new Ordnance Survey head office|url=http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/news/2011/09/duke-of-edinburgh-opens-os-hq.html|publisher=Ordnance Survey|accessdate=11 March 2012}}</ref> The [[Lloyd's Register|Lloyd's Register Group]] has announced plans to move its London marine operations to a specially developed site at the University of Southampton.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.lr.org/Industries/Marine/News/1706+Southampton.htm|accessdate =19 October 2009|date = 21 April 2006|author=Lloyd's Register|title = Lloyd's Register announces plans to move Marine operations to Southampton|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080801171302/http://www.lr.org/Industries/Marine/News/1706+Southampton.htm |archivedate = 1 August 2008}}</ref>

Southampton had two disused shopping centres: the 1970s Eaststreet mall, and the 1980s Bargate centre. Neither of these were ever commercially successful. The former was demolished and the site earmarked for redevelopment as a Morrison's supermarket. It was anounced in January 2017 that the Bargate Centre is also scheduled for demolition, to be replaced by retail premises, student accommodation and apartments. Included are also proposals to open access to a section of the medieval city wall in that area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Southampton's historic centre set for revival as multi-million pound redevelopment approved|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/15014317.PHOTOS__Multi_million_pound_regeneration_plans_approved_for_Southampton_city_centre___take_a_look/|website=Southern Evening Echo|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref> There is also the East Street area which has been designated for speciality shopping, with the aim of promoting smaller retailers, alongside the chain store [[Debenhams]].

Southampton's strong economy is promoting redevelopment, and major projects are proposed, including the city's first skyscrapers on the waterfront. The three towers proposed will stand 23 storeys high and will be surrounded by smaller apartment blocks, office blocks and shops. There are also plans for a 15-storey hotel at the Ocean Village marina,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/search/display.var.772549.0.grand_designs_for_new_hotel.php| accessdate =19 October 2009| date = 25 May 2006| author=Southern Daily Echo

The building, located on Southern Road, opened in 2011 and is near to [[Southampton Central railway station]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Southampton's £30m police HQ opens|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-12659487|accessdate=11 March 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=7 March 2011}}</ref> Previously, the central Southampton operation was located within the west wing of the Civic Centre, however the ageing facilities and the plans of constructing a new museum in the old police station and magistrates court necessitated the move. There are additional police stations at [[Portswood]], Banister Park and [[Shirley, Southampton|Shirley]] as well as a [[British Transport Police]] station at Southampton Central railway station.

Southampton's fire cover is provided by [[Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service]]. There are three fire stations within the city boundaries at [[St Mary's, Hampshire|St Mary's]], Hightown and [[Redbridge, Hampshire|Redbridge]].

The ambulance service is provided by [[South Central Ambulance Service]].

The national headquarters of the [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] is located in Commercial Road.

==Crime==
According to Hampshire Constabulary figures, Southampton is currently safer than it has ever been before, with dramatic reductions in violent crime year on year for the last three years.
Data from the Southampton Safer City Partnership shows there has been a reduction in all crimes in recent years and an increase in crime detection rates.<ref>{{cite web|author=Name of file |url=http://www.southampton.gov.uk/living/safersouthampton/ |title=Safer Southampton – Southampton City Council |publisher=Southampton.gov.uk |date=15 October 2012 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>
According to government figures Southampton has a higher crime rate than the national average.<ref name="homeoffice.gov.uk">{{cite web
|url = http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/laa1.xls|accessdate =10 September 2007|author=Home Office|title = Local Authority Crime Statistics}}</ref> There is some controversy regarding comparative crime statistics due to inconsistencies between different police forces recording methodologies. For example, in Hampshire all reported incidents are recorded and all records then retained. However, in neighbouring Dorset crimes reports withdrawn or shown to be false are not recorded, reducing apparent crime figures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.npia.police.uk/docs/hors/hors204.pdf |title=Home Office Research Study 204 Review of police forces' crime recording practices |format=PDF |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>
In the violence against the person category, the national average is 16.7 per 1000 population while Southampton is 42.4 per 1000 population. In the theft from a vehicle category, the national average is 7.6 per 1000 compared to Southampton's 28.4 per 1000. Overall, for every 1,000&nbsp;people in the city, 202 crimes are recorded.<ref name="homeoffice.gov.uk"/>
Hampshire Constabulary's figures for 2009/10 show fewer incidents of recorded crime in Southampton than the previous year.<ref>{{cite web

In addition to school sixth forms at [[St. Anne's Catholic School (Southampton)|St Anne's]] and [[King Edward VI School, Southampton|King Edward's]] there are two sixth form colleges: [[Itchen College]] and [[Richard Taunton Sixth Form College]]. A number of Southampton pupils will travel outside the city, for example to [[Barton Peveril College]]. [[Southampton City College]] is a [[further education]] college serving the city.

==Transport==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
{{Main article|History of Southampton#Transport History}}

===Road===
Southampton is a major UK port which has good transport links with the rest of the country. The [[M27 motorway]], linking places along the south coast of England, runs just to the north of the city. The [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3 motorway]] links the city to London and also, via a link to the [[A34 road (England)|A34]] (part of the [[European route E05]]) at [[Winchester]], with the Midlands and North. The [[M271 motorway]] is a spur of the M27, linking it with the Western Docks and city centre.

===Rail===
[[File:Southamptoncentral.jpg|thumb|Southampton Central railway station]]

Southampton is also served by the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|rail network]], which is used both by freight services to and from the docks and passenger services as part of the [[National Rail|national rail]] system. The main station in the city is [[Southampton Central railway station|Southampton Central]]. Rail routes run east towards [[Portsmouth]], north to Winchester, the Midlands and London, and westwards to [[Bournemouth]], [[Poole]], [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]], [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], [[Salisbury]], Bristol and [[Cardiff]]. The route to London was opened in 1840 by what was to become the [[London and South Western Railway]] Company. Both this and its successor the [[Southern Railway (UK)]] played a significant role in the creation of the modern port following their purchase and development of the town's docks.

Local train services operate in the central, southern and eastern sections of the city and are operated by [[South West Trains]], with stations at [[Swaythling railway station|Swaythling]], [[St Denys railway station|St Denys]], [[Millbrook (Southampton) railway station|Millbrook]], [[Redbridge railway station|Redbridge]], [[Bitterne railway station|Bitterne]], [[Sholing railway station|Sholing]] and [[Woolston railway station|Woolston]]. Plans were announced by [[Hampshire County Council]] in July 2009 for the introduction of [[tram-train]] running from [[Hythe, Hampshire|Hythe]] (on what is now a [[freight]]-only line to [[Fawley, Hampshire|Fawley]]) via [[Totton]] to Southampton Central Station and on to [[Fareham]] via St. Denys, and Swanwick.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/search/4469643.Plans_for_tram_trains_through_Southampton/ |title=Plans for tram-trains through Southampton (From Daily Echo) |publisher=Dailyecho.co.uk |date=1 July 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2009}}</ref> The proposal follows a failed plan to bring light rail to the Portsmouth and Gosport areas in 2005.

The town was the subject of an attempt by a separate company, the [[Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway]], to open another rail route to the North in the 1880s and some building work, including a surviving embankment, was undertaken in the Hill Lane area.<ref name="Sands">{{cite book |title=Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway |last=Sands |first=T.B. |isbn=978-0-85361-023-6 |page=16}}</ref>

===Air===
[[Southampton Airport]] is a regional airport located in the town of [[Eastleigh]], just north of the city. It offers flights to UK and near European destinations, and is connected to the city by a frequent rail service from [[Southampton Airport (Parkway) railway station]], and by bus services.

===Cruise shipping===
[[File:Queen Mary 2.JPG|thumb|right|{{RMS|Queen Mary 2}} in the Southampton Dock]]

Southampton's tradition of luxury cruising began in the 1840s, one of the pioneers being [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] who advertised tours to Egypt.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Arnott|first1=Alastair|title=Southampton, Gateway to the World|page=68|accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref>

Many of the world's largest cruise ships can regularly be seen in Southampton water, including record-breaking vessels from [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]] and [[Carnival Corporation & plc]]. The latter has headquarters in Southampton, with its brands including [[Princess Cruises]], [[P&O Cruises]] and [[Cunard Line]].

The city has a particular connection to Cunard Line and their fleet of ships. This was particularly evident on 11 November 2008 when the Cunard liner {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth 2}} departed the city for the final time amid a spectacular fireworks display after a full day of celebrations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chriscunard.com/qe2_retirement.htm|title=QE2 Retirement – Southampton Video Included|publisher=}}</ref> Cunard ships are regularly launched in the city, for example {{MS|Queen Victoria|3=2}} was named by [[Royal Highness|HRH]] [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|The Duchess of Cornwall]] in December 2007, and [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] named [[MS Queen Elizabeth|''Queen Elizabeth'']] in the city during October 2011. The [[Duchess of Cambridge]] performed the naming ceremony of ''[[Royal Princess]]'' on 13 June 2013.

At certain times of the year, The Queen Mary 2, Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria may all visit Southampton at the same time, in an event commonly called 'Arrival of the Three Queens'.

The importance of Southampton to the cruise industry was indicated by [[P&O Cruises]]'s 175th anniversary celebrations, which included all seven of the company's liners visiting Southampton in a single day. ''[[Adonia]]'', ''[[Arcadia]]'', ''Aurora'', ''Azura'', ''Oceana'', ''Oriana'' and ''Ventura'' all left the city in a procession on 3 July 2012.<ref>{{Citation | title = Magnificent seven ships to make up 'The Grand Event' at Southampton | newspaper = Southern Daily Echo | date = 18 April 2012 | url = http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/9655678.Magnificent_seven_ships_to_make_up__The_Grand_Event__at_Southampton/ | accessdate =18 April 2012}}</ref>

===Ferry===
While Southampton is no longer the base for any cross-channel ferries, it is the terminus for three internal ferry services, all of which operate from terminals at [[Town Quay]]. Two of these, a [[RORO|car ferry]] service and a fast [[catamaran]] passenger ferry service, provide links to [[Cowes|East Cowes]] and [[Cowes]] respectively on the [[Isle of Wight]] and are operated by [[Red Funnel]]. The third ferry is the [[Hythe Pier, Railway and Ferry|Hythe Ferry]], providing a passenger service to [[Hythe, Hampshire|Hythe]] on the other side of [[Southampton Water]].

Southampton used to be home to a number of ferry services to the continent, with destinations such as [[San Sebastián|San Sebastian]], [[Lisbon]], [[Tangier]] and [[Casablanca]]. A ferry port was built during the 1960s.<ref>[http://www.plimsoll.org/Southampton/TheDocks/EasternDocks/OuterDock3.asp The result appeared to be very successful] Retrieved 2 January 2008</ref> However, a number of these relocated to Portsmouth and by 1996, there were no longer any car ferries operating from Southampton with the exception of services to the [[Isle of Wight]]. The land used for Southampton Ferry Port was sold off and a retail and housing development was built on the site. The Princess Alexandra Dock was converted into a marina. Reception areas for new cars now fill the Eastern Docks where passengers, dry docks and trains used to be.

===Bus===
Buses now provide the majority of local public transport. The main [[bus]] operators are [[First Hampshire & Dorset|First Southampton]], [[Bluestar (bus company)|Bluestar]], [[Xelabus]] and Wheelers. The other large service provider is the [[Unilink]] bus service (running from early in the morning to midnight), which was commissioned by the [[University of Southampton]] to provide transport from the university to the town. Previously run by [[Enterprise (bus company)|Enterprise]], it is now run by [[Bluestar (bus company)|Bluestar]]. [[Zero-fare public transport|Free]] buses were provided by [[Unilink#City-link shuttle service|City-link]]',<ref>[http://www.southampton.gov.uk/Images/9.%20Transport%20investment%20plans%20-%20Integrated%20transport_tcm46-160704.pdf Southampton Local Transport Plan 2001/2 to 2005/6] Retrieved 10 May 2007</ref> but the subsidy provided by Southampton City Council was pulled in 2014 and the service now charges passengers £1 flat rate single fare, with Red Funnel ticket holders continuing to travel free.<ref>{{cite web|title=Citylink changes 12th May|url=http://www.bluestarbus.co.uk/article.shtml?articleid=3476}}</ref> The service was rebranded as QuayConnect in May 2016, with a red and white livery on the bus instead of blue. It runs from the [[Red Funnel]] ferry terminals at [[Town Quay]] to [[Southampton Central railway station|Central station]] via Westquay and is operated by Bluestar.<ref>[http://www.bluestarbus.co.uk/routelist.shtml Bluestar – Route list]. Retrieved 4 October 2008.</ref> There is also a door-to-door minibus service called Southampton Dial a Ride, for residents who cannot access public transport. This is funded by the council and operated by SCA Support Services.

There are two main termini for bus services. First uses stops around Pound Tree Road and Vincent's Walk, except the X4 to Portsmouth and X5 to Gosport, which start and end their journeys from Westquay. This leaves the other terminal of West Quay available for other operators. [[Unilink]] passes West Quay in both directions, and the Salisbury Reds X7 service to Salisbury drops passengers off and pick them up there, terminating at a series of bus stands along the road. Certain Bluestar services also do this, while others stop at Bargate and some loop round West Quay, stopping at Hanover Buildings. There was a [[Southampton Corporation Tramways|tram system]] from 1879 to 1949.
