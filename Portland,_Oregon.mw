'''Portland''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɔr|t|l|ə|n|d}}) is the [[List of cities in Oregon|largest city]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]] and the [[county seat|seat]] of [[Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah County]]. It is a major [[port]] in the [[Willamette Valley]] region of the [[Pacific Northwest]], at the [[confluence]] of the [[Willamette River|Willamette]] and [[Columbia River|Columbia]] Rivers. The city covers {{convert|145|sqmi|km2|abbr=off|sp=us}} and had an estimated population of 639,863 in 2016, <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2017/05/2016_census_population_estimat.html?appSession=24387751479934270152753519895483605060548990489286043547771135922825617294805327600501467784361715188085804327679954816908871521|title=2016 Census population estimates for every U.S. city, county, state (database)|publisher=}}</ref> making it the [[List of United States cities by population|26th most populous]] city in the United States.

Named after [[Portland, Maine]], the Oregon settlement began to be populated in the 1830s near the end of the [[Oregon Trail]]. Its water access provided convenient transportation of goods, and the timber industry was a major force in the city's early economy. At the turn of the 20th century, the city had a reputation as one of the most dangerous [[port city|port cities]] in the world, a hub for organized crime and [[racketeering]]. After the city's economy experienced an industrial boom during [[World War II]], its hard-edged reputation began to dissipate. Beginning in the 1960s,<ref name="1960s"/> Portland became noted for its growing [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] political values, and the city has earned a reputation as a bastion of [[counterculture]], which proceeded into the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/articles/451788/dont-let-portlandia-ruin-portland|work=The Week|title=Don't let Portlandia ruin Portland|author=Weber, Peter|date=January 13, 2014|accessdate=October 30, 2015}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main article|History of Portland, Oregon|Timeline of Portland, Oregon}}

===Pre-history and natives===
During the [[prehistoric period]], the land that would become Portland was flooded after the collapse of glacial dams from [[Lake Missoula]], located in what would later become [[Montana]]. These massive floods occurred during the last [[ice age]] and filled the [[Willamette Valley]] with {{convert|300|to|400|ft|m}} of water.{{Sfn|Allen|Burns|Sargent|2009|pages=175–189}}

Before American pioneers began arriving in the 1800s, the land that eventually became Portland and surrounding [[Multnomah County]] was inhabited for many centuries by two bands of indigenous [[Chinook people]]— the [[Multnomah people|Multnomah]] and the [[Clackamas people|Clackamas]] peoples.{{sfn|Marschner|2008|p=187}} The Chinook people occupying the land which would become Portland were first documented by [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark]] [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|in 1805]].<ref name="anderson"/> Before its European settlement, the Portland Basin of the lower [[Columbia River]] and [[Willamette River]] valleys had been one of the most densely populated regions on the Pacific Coast.<ref name="anderson">{{cite web|url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bps/article/214638|work=City of Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability|author=Anderson, Susan|date=2009|title=East Portland Historical Overview & Historic Preservation Study|accessdate=October 30, 2015}}</ref>

Large numbers of pioneer settlers began arriving in the [[Willamette Valley]] in the 1830s via the [[Oregon Trail]], though life was originally centered in nearby [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]]. In the early 1840s a new settlement began emerging ten miles from the mouth of the [[Willamette River]],{{sfn|Scott|1890|p=61}} roughly halfway between Oregon City and [[Fort Vancouver]]. This community was initially referred to as "Stumptown" and "The Clearing" because of the many trees cut down to allow for its growth.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Orloff |first=Chet |year=2004 |title=Maintaining Eden: John Charles Olmsted and the Portland Park System |journal=Yearbook of the Association of Pacific Coast Geographers |volume=66 |pages=114–119 |doi=10.1353/pcg.2004.0006 }}</ref> In 1843 [[William Overton (Portland founder)|William Overton]] saw potential in the new settlement but lacked the funds to file an official land claim. For 25 cents Overton agreed to share half of the {{convert|640|acre|km2|adj=on}} site with [[Asa Lovejoy]] of [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/historical_records/dspDocument.cfm?doc_ID=000128AC-3AC7-1E8B-891B80B0527200A7 |work=Oregon History Project |title=Overton Cabin |accessdate=October 29, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015811/http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/historical_records/dspDocument.cfm?doc_ID=000128AC-3AC7-1E8B-891B80B0527200A7 |archivedate=November 17, 2015 }}</ref>

In 1845 Overton sold his remaining half of the claim to [[Francis W. Pettygrove]] of [[Portland, Maine]]. Both Pettygrove and Lovejoy wished to rename "The Clearing" after their respective hometowns (Lovejoy's being Boston, and Pettygrove's, Portland). This controversy was settled with a [[coin toss]] which Pettygrove won in a series of two out of three tosses, thereby providing Portland with its namesake.<ref name="naosum.org">{{cite web| title = Portland: The Town that was Almost Boston | publisher=National Association of Scientific Materials Managers | url = http://www.naosmm.org/confer/port-or/history.html | accessdate = March 7, 2013}}</ref> The coin used for this decision, now known as the [[Portland Penny]], is on display in the headquarters of the [[Oregon Historical Society]].

Portland's access to the Pacific Ocean via the Willamette and the Columbia rivers, as well as its easy access to the agricultural [[Tualatin Valley]] via the "[[Great Plank Road]]" (the route of current-day [[U.S. Route 26 (Oregon)|U.S. Route 26]]), provided the pioneer city with an advantage over other nearby ports, and it grew very quickly.<ref>"City keeps lively pulse". (Spencer Heinz, ''[[The Oregonian]]'', January 23, 2001)</ref> Portland remained the major port in the Pacific Northwest for much of the 19th century, until the 1890s, when [[Seattle]]'s deepwater harbor was connected to the rest of the mainland by rail, affording an inland route without the treacherous navigation of the Columbia River. The [[lumber industry]] also became a prominent economical presence, due to the area's large population of [[Douglas Fir]]s, [[Western Hemlock]]s, [[Thuja plicata|Red Cedars]], and [[Acer macrophyllum|Big Leaf Maple]] trees.<ref name="anderson"/>

===Topography===
[[File:Mt. St. Helens, Mt Rainier, Seen from Mount Calvary Cemetery (Portland, Oregon).jpg|thumb|[[Mt. Rainier]] (left) and [[Mt. St. Helens]] (right) photographed from [[Mount Calvary Cemetery (Portland, Oregon)|Mount Calvary Cemetery]] in Portland.]]

Portland is located 60 miles east of the [[Pacific Ocean]] at the northern end of [[Oregon]]'s most populated region, the [[Willamette Valley]]. Downtown Portland straddles the banks of the [[Willamette River]], which flows north through the city center and consequently separates the east and west neighborhoods of the city. Less than 10 miles from downtown, the Willamette River flows into the [[Columbia River]], the fourth-largest river in the United States, which divides Oregon from Washington state. Portland is about 100 miles upriver from the Pacific Ocean on the Columbia.

Though much of downtown Portland is relatively flat, the foothills of the [[Tualatin Mountains]], more commonly referred to locally as the "West Hills", pierce through the northwest and southwest reaches of the city. [[Council Crest Park]], the tallest point within city limits, is located in the West Hills and rises to an elevation of 1,073 feet. The highest point east of the river is [[Mount Tabor, Portland, Oregon|Mt. Tabor]], an extinct volcanic cinder cone, which rises to 636 feet. Nearby [[Powell Butte]] and [[Rocky Butte]] rise to 614 feet and 612 feet, respectively. To the west of the Tualatin Mountains lies the [[Oregon Coast Range]], and to the east lies the actively volcanic [[Cascade Range]]. On clear days, [[Mount Hood|Mt. Hood]] and [[Mount St. Helens|Mt. St. Helens]] dominate the horizon, while [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mt. Adams]] and [[Mount Rainier|Mt. Rainier]] can also be visible in the distance.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|145.09|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|133.43|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|11.66|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name="Gazetteer files">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=December 21, 2012|archivedate= July 14, 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/699nOulzi?url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt }}</ref> Although almost all of Portland lies within [[Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah County]], small portions of the city lie within [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas]] and [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington]] Counties, with populations estimated at 785 and 1,455, respectively.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Portland lies on top of an extinct volcanic field known as the [[Boring Lava Field]], named after the nearby [[commuter town|bedroom community]] of [[Boring, Oregon|Boring]].<ref name="volcano">{{cite web| title = The Boring Lava Field, Portland, Oregon | publisher=[[USGS]] Cascades Volcano Observatory | url = http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/Oregon/BoringLavaField/description_boring_lava.html | accessdate = November 7, 2006 }}</ref> The Boring Lava Field contains at least 32 cinder cones such as [[Mount Tabor, Portland, Oregon|Mount Tabor]],<ref>{{cite web| title = Mount Tabor Cinder Cone, Portland, Oregon | publisher=[[USGS]] Cascades Volcano Observatory | url = http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/Oregon/BoringLavaField/VisitVolcano/mount_tabor.html | accessdate = April 20, 2007}}</ref> and its center lies in southeast Portland. [[Mount St. Helens]], a highly active volcano 50 miles northeast of the city in Washington State, is easily visible on clear days and is close enough to have dusted the city with volcanic ash after its [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|eruption on May 18, 1980.]]<ref>{{Cite news|title=History, relived saved from St. Helens by a six-pack of Fresca|last=Nokes|first=R.

===Cityscape===
{{See also|Architecture of Portland, Oregon|List of tallest buildings in Portland, Oregon|Downtown Portland}}

Portland's cityscape derives much of its character from the numerous bridges that span the [[Willamette River]] downtown, several of which are historic landmarks, and Portland has been nicknamed "Bridgetown" for many decades as a result.<ref name="bridgetown"/> Three of downtown's most heavily utilized bridges are more than 100 years old and are designated historic landmarks: [[Hawthorne Bridge]] (1910), [[Steel Bridge]] (1912), and [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] (1913). Portland's newest bridge in the downtown area, [[Tilikum Crossing]], opened in 2015 and is the first new bridge to span the Willamette in Portland since the 1973 opening of the double-decker [[Fremont Bridge (Portland)|Fremont Bridge]].

Other bridges that span the Willamette river in the downtown area include the [[Burnside Bridge]], the [[Ross Island Bridge]] (both built 1926), and the double-decker [[Marquam Bridge]] (built 1966). Other bridges outside the downtown area include the [[Sellwood Bridge]] (built 2016) to the south; and the [[St. Johns Bridge]], a [[Gothic revival]] suspension bridge built in 1931, to the north. The [[Glenn L. Jackson Memorial Bridge]] and the [[Interstate Bridge]] provide access from Portland across the Columbia River into Washington state.

[[File:Portland.png|thumb|left|The five "quadrants" of Portland]]
The Willamette River, which flows north through downtown, serves as the natural boundary between east and west Portland. The denser and earlier-developed west side extends into the lap of the [[Tualatin Mountains|West Hills]], while the flatter east side fans out for roughly 180 blocks until it meets the suburb of [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]]. In 1891 the cities of Portland, [[Albina, Oregon|Albina]], and [[East Portland, Oregon|East Portland]] were consolidated, creating inconsistent patterns of street names and addresses. The "great renumbering" on September 2, 1931 standardized street naming patterns, divided Portland into five official quadrants, and changed house numbers from 20 per block to 100 per block.<ref>{{Citation|title=Ordinance 61325: Street re-numbering report.

[[File:Downtown Portland, OR by Paul Nelson.jpg|thumb|right|Southern downtown Portland along the Willamette riverfront.]]

The five quadrants of Portland have come to develop distinctive identities over time, with mild cultural differences and friendly rivalries between their residents, especially between those who live east of the Willamette River versus west of the river.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://djcoregon.com/news/2012/07/16/perceptions-of-central-eastside-industrial-district-changing/ |title=Perceptions of Portland's east side changing |publisher=DJCOregon.com |accessdate=March 2, 2015|date=July 16, 2012|author=Reed, Jackson}}</ref> The official quadrants of Portland are: North, Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, and Southeast, with [[downtown Portland]] being located in the SW quadrant. The Willamette River divides the east and west quadrants while [[Burnside Street]], which traverses the entire city lengthwise, divides the north and south quadrants. All addresses within the city are denoted as belonging to one of these specific quadrants with the prefixes: N, NW, NE, SW or SE.
[[File:Steam tug PORTLAND - Portland Oregon.jpg|thumb|Lloyd District, Downtown Portland]]
Though officially located in SW Portland, the RiverPlace, John's Landing and South Waterfront neighborhoods lie in a so-called (but unofficial) "sixth quadrant" called South Portland, where addresses rise higher from west to east toward the river. This "sixth quadrant" is roughly bounded by Naito Parkway and Barbur Boulevard to the west, Montgomery Street to the north and Nevada Street to the south. East-West addresses in this area are denoted with a leading zero (instead of a minus sign). This means 0246 SW California St. is not the same as 246 SW California St. Many mapping programs are unable to distinguish between the two.

==Law and government==
{{See also|Government of Portland, Oregon}}
[[File:PortlandCityHall.jpg|left|thumb|[[Portland City Hall (Oregon)|Portland City Hall]]]]

The city of Portland is governed by the Portland City Council, which includes the Mayor, four Commissioners, and an [[auditor]]. Each is elected citywide to serve a four-year term. The auditor provides checks and balances in the commission form of government and accountability for the use of public resources. In addition, the auditor provides access to information and reports on various matters of city government.

The city's Office of Neighborhood Involvement serves as a conduit between city government and Portland's [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon|95 officially recognized neighborhoods]]. Each neighborhood is represented by a volunteer-based [[neighborhood association]] which serves as a liaison between residents of the neighborhood and the city government. The city provides funding to neighborhood associations through seven district coalitions, each of which is a geographical grouping of several neighborhood associations. Most (but not all) neighborhood associations belong to one of these district coalitions.

Portland and its surrounding metropolitan area are served by [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro]], the United States' only directly elected [[metropolitan planning organization]]. Metro's charter gives it responsibility for [[land use]] and [[transportation planning]], [[solid waste management]], and map development. Metro also owns and operates the [[Oregon Convention Center]], [[Oregon Zoo]], [[Portland Center for the Performing Arts]], and [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center]].

The [[Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah County]] government provides many services to the Portland area, as do [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington]] and [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas]] counties to the west and south.

Law enforcement is provided by the [[Portland Police Bureau]]. Fire and emergency services are provided by [[Portland Fire & Rescue]].

===Politics===
Portland is a territorial [[charter city]], and strongly favors the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. All city offices are technically [[non-partisan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandonline.com/Auditor/Index.cfm?a=9178&c=27481|work=Portland Online|title=City Government Structure|author=Caballero, Mary Hull|accessdate=October 30, 2015}}</ref>

Portland's delegation to the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] is entirely Democratic. In the current [[76th Oregon Legislative Assembly]], which first convened in 2011, four state Senators represent Portland in the [[Oregon State Senate|state Senate]]: [[Diane Rosenbaum]] (District 21), [[Chip Shields]] (District 22), [[Jackie Dingfelder]] (District 23), and [[Rod Monroe]] (District 24). Portland sends six Representatives to the [[Oregon House of Representatives|state House of Representatives]]: [[Jules Bailey]] (District 42), [[Lew Frederick]] (District 43), [[Tina Kotek]] (District 44), [[Michael Dembrow]] (District 45), [[Alissa Keny-Guyer]] (District 46), and [[Jefferson Smith (Oregon politician)|Jefferson Smith]] (District 47).

Portland is split among three U.S. [[congressional districts]]. Most of the city is in the [[Oregon's 3rd congressional district|3rd District]], represented by [[Earl Blumenauer]], who served on the city council from 1986 until his election to Congress in 1996. Most of the city west of the Willamette River is part of the [[Oregon's 1st congressional district|1st District]], represented by [[Suzanne Bonamici]]. A small portion of southwestern Portland is in the [[Oregon's 5th congressional district|5th District]], represented by [[Kurt Schrader]]. All three are Democrats; a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] has not represented a significant portion of Portland in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] since 1975. Both of Oregon's senators, [[Ron Wyden]] and [[Jeff Merkley]], are from Portland and are also both Democrats.

In the [[United States presidential election in Oregon, 2008|2008 presidential election]], Democratic candidate [[Barack Obama]] easily carried Portland, winning 245,464 votes from city residents to 50,614 for his [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] rival, [[John McCain]].  In the [[United States presidential election in Oregon, 2012|2012 presidential election]], Democratic candidate [[Barack Obama]] again easily carried Portland, winning 256,925 votes from Multnomah county residents to 70,958 for his [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] rival, [[Mitt Romney]].<ref>[[The Oregonian]], [http://gov.oregonlive.com/election/2012/Multnomah/ Oregon 2012 election results for Multnomah County], retrieved December 4, 2013</ref>

===Planning and development===
[[File:Urban Growth Portland Oregon.ogv|thumb|Video of Portland's urban growth boundary. The red dots indicate areas of growth between 1986 and 1996. ([[:File:Urban Growth Portland Oregon.ogv|larger size]])]]
The city consulted with urban planners as far back as 1903. Development of [[Washington Park (Portland, Oregon)|Washington Park]] and one of the country's finest greenways, the [[40 Mile Loop]], which interconnects many of the city's parks, began.

Portland is often cited as an example of a city with strong [[land use planning]] controls.<ref name="smartplan" /> This is largely the result of statewide land conservation policies adopted in 1973 under Governor [[Tom McCall]], in particular the requirement for an [[urban growth boundary]] (UGB) for every city and metropolitan area. The opposite extreme, a city with few or no controls, is typically illustrated by [[Houston|Houston, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/hotproperty/archives/2007/10/how_houston_get.html |title=How Houston gets along without zoning&nbsp;– BusinessWeek |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |accessdate=October 20, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/cityguides/houston/2003-10-07-spotlight-zoning_x.htm |title=Houston: A city without zoning |work=USA Today |first=Sherry |last=Thomas |date=October 30, 2003 |accessdate=January 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetizen.com/node/109 |title=Zoning Without Zoning &#124; Planetizen |publisher=Planetizen.com |author=Michael Lewyn |accessdate=October 20, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DEFDB103FF934A2575BC0A960948260 |title=FOCUS: Houston; A Fresh Approach To Zoning&nbsp;|work=The New York Times |author=Robert Reinhold |date=August 17, 1986 |accessdate=October 20, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2006/04/10/editorial1.html |title='The only major U.S. city without zoning'|work=Houston Business Journal |date=April 9, 2006|accessdate=October 20, 2008 |first=Bill |last=Schadewald}}</ref>

Portland's urban growth boundary, adopted in 1979, separates urban areas (where high-density development is encouraged and focused) from traditional farm land (where restrictions on non-agricultural development are very strict).<ref>[http://www.oregon.gov/LCD/Pages/goals.aspx Statewide Planning Goals]. Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development. Retrieved December 23, 2007.</ref> This was atypical in an era when automobile use led many areas to neglect their core cities in favor of development along [[interstate highway]]s, in suburbs, and [[satellite city|satellite cities]].

The original state rules included a provision for expanding urban growth boundaries, but critics felt this wasn't being accomplished. In 1995, the State passed a law requiring cities to expand UGBs to provide enough undeveloped land for a 20-year supply of future housing at projected growth levels.<ref>{{cite web| title = Comprehensive Land Use Planning Coordination | work=Legislative Counsel Committee of the Oregon Legislative Assembly | url = http://www.leg.state.or.us/ors/197.html | accessdate = November 7, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028035146/http://www.leg.state.or.us/ors/197.html|archivedate=October 28, 2012}}</ref>

Oregon's 1973 "[[urban growth boundary]]" law limits the boundaries for large-scale development in each metropolitan area in Oregon.<ref name="metro_ugb">{{cite web| title = Urban growth boundary | url=http://www.oregonmetro.gov/index.cfm/go/by.web/id/277 | publisher = Metro | accessdate = February 26, 2013 }}</ref> This limits access to utilities such as sewage, water and telecommunications, as well as coverage by fire, police and schools.<ref name="metro_ugb" /> Originally this law mandated that the city must maintain enough land within the boundary to provide an estimated 20 years of growth; however, in 2007 the legislature altered the law to require the maintenance of an estimated 50 years of growth within the boundary, as well as the protection of accompanying farm and rural lands.<ref name="pt_growth" />

[[File:PortlandOR-aerial.jpg|thumb|175px|Aerial view of central Portland]]
The growth boundary, along with efforts of the PDC to create economic development zones, has led to the development of a large portion of downtown, a large number of mid- and high-rise developments, and an overall increase in housing and business density.<ref name="ssp_portland">{{cite web| title = Portland&nbsp;– SkyscraperPage | url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?cityID=29 | accessdate = June 4, 2008}}</ref><ref name="olmis_jobgrowth">{{cite web| title = OLMIS&nbsp;– Portland Metro Area: A Look at Recent Job Growth | url=http://www.qualityinfo.org/olmisj/ArticleReader?itemid=00005735 | accessdate = June 4, 2008}}</ref>

The [[Portland Development Commission]] is a semi-public agency that plays a major role in downtown development; it was created by city voters in 1958 to serve as the city's [[urban renewal]] agency. It provides housing and economic development programs within the city, and works behind the scenes with major local developers to create large projects.

In the early 1960s, the PDC led the razing of a large Italian-Jewish neighborhood downtown, bounded roughly by I-405, the Willamette River, 4th Avenue and Market street.

Mayor [[Neil Goldschmidt]] took office in 1972 as a proponent of bringing housing and the associated vitality back to the downtown area, which was seen as emptying out after 5&nbsp;pm. The effort has had dramatic effects in the 30 years since, with many thousands of new housing units clustered in three areas: north of Portland State University (between I-405, SW Broadway, and SW Taylor St.); the RiverPlace development along the waterfront under the Marquam (I-5) bridge; and most notably in the Pearl District (between I-405, Burnside St., NW Northrup St., and NW 9th Ave.).

The Urban Greenspaces Institute, housed in [[Portland State University]] Geography Department's Center for Mapping Research, promotes better integration of the built and natural environments. The institute works on urban park, trail, and natural areas planning issues, both at the local and regional levels.{{sfn|Platt|2006|p=43}} In October 2009, the Portland City Council unanimously adopted a climate action plan that will cut the city's greenhouse gas emissions to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://portlandtribune.com/component/content/article?id=57411|title=Council adopts aggressive Climate Action Plan|author=Law, Steve|newspaper=[[Portland Tribune]]|date=October 27, 2009|accessdate=July 6, 2013}}</ref>

The Portland metropolitan area has transportation services common to major U.S. cities, though Oregon's emphasis on proactive [[Land use forecasting|land-use planning]] and [[transit-oriented development]] within the [[urban growth boundary]] means that commuters have multiple well-developed options. In 2014, ''Travel + Leisure'' magazine rated Portland as the #1 most pedestrian and transit-friendly city in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-favorite-cities|title=America's Favorite Cities|date=October 7, 2014 |work=Travel + Leisure |accessdate=November 10, 2015}}</ref> A 2011 study by [[Walk Score]] ranked Portland 12th most walkable of fifty largest U.S. cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walkscore.com/rankings/cities/|title=2011 City and Neighborhood Rankings |publisher=Walk Score |year=2011 |accessdate=August 28, 2011}}</ref>
