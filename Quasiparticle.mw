In [[physics]], '''quasiparticles''' and '''collective excitations''' (which are closely related) are [[emergent phenomena]] that occur when a microscopically complicated system such as a [[solid]] behaves ''as if'' it contained different weakly interacting [[particle]]s in [[free space]]. For example, as an [[electron]] travels through a [[semiconductor]], its motion is disturbed in a complex way by its interactions with all of the other electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]; however it ''approximately'' behaves like an electron with a ''different mass'' ([[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]) traveling unperturbed through [[free space]]. This "electron" with a different mass is called an "electron quasiparticle".<ref name=Kaxiras/> In another example, the aggregate motion of electrons in the [[valence band]] of a [[semiconductor]] or a hole band in a metal<ref name="ashcroftandmermin">{{cite book|last1=Ashcroft and Mermin|title=Solid State Physics|date=1976|publisher=Holt, Reinhart, and Winston|isbn=0030839939|pages=299–302|edition=1st|accessdate=}}</ref> is the same as if the material instead contained positively charged quasiparticles called [[electron hole|holes]]. Other quasiparticles or collective excitations include [[phonon]]s (particles derived from the vibrations of atoms in a solid), [[plasmon]]s (particles derived from [[plasma oscillation]]s), and many others.

These particles are typically called "quasiparticles" if they are related to [[fermion]]s, and called "collective excitations" if they are related to [[boson]]s,<ref name=Kaxiras/> although the precise distinction is not universally agreed upon.<ref name=Mattuck>[https://books.google.com/books?id=pe-v8zfxE68C&pg=PA10 	''A guide to Feynman diagrams in the many-body problem'', by Richard D. Mattuck, p10]. "As we have seen, the quasiparticle consists of the original real, individual particle, plus a cloud of disturbed neighbors. It behaves very much like an individual particle, except that it has an effective mass and a lifetime. But there also exist other kinds of fictitious particles in many-body systems, i.e. 'collective excitations'. These do not center around individual particles, but instead involve collective, wavelike motion of ''all'' the particles in the system simultaneously."</ref> Thus, electrons and [[electron hole|holes]] are typically called "quasiparticles", while phonons and plasmons are typically called "collective excitations".

The quasiparticle concept is most important in [[condensed matter physics]] since it is one of the few known ways of simplifying the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[many-body problem]].

==Overview==

===General introduction===
[[Solid]]s are made of only three kinds of [[particle physics|particles]]: [[Electron]]s, [[proton]]s, and [[neutron]]s. Quasiparticles are none of these; instead, each of them is an ''[[emergent phenomenon]]'' that occurs inside the solid. Therefore, while it is quite possible to have a single particle (electron or proton or neutron) floating in space, a ''quasi''particle can instead only exist inside the solid.

Motion in a solid is extremely complicated: Each electron and proton is pushed and pulled (by [[Coulomb's law]]) by all the other electrons and protons in the solid (which may themselves be in motion). It is these strong interactions that make it very difficult to predict and understand the behavior of solids (see [[many-body problem]]). On the other hand, the motion of a ''non-interacting'' particle is quite simple: In [[classical mechanics]], it would move in a straight line, and in quantum mechanics, it would move in a superposition of [[plane wave]]s. This is the motivation for the concept of quasiparticles: The complicated motion of the ''actual'' particles in a solid can be mathematically transformed into the much simpler motion of imagined ''quasi''particles, which behave more like non-interacting particles.

In summary, quasiparticles are a mathematical tool for simplifying the description of solids. They are not "real" particles inside the solid. Instead, saying "A quasiparticle is present" or "A quasiparticle is moving" is shorthand for saying "A large number of electrons and nuclei are moving in a specific coordinated way."

===Relation to many-body quantum mechanics===
[[Image:Energy levels.svg|thumb|right|Any system, no matter how complicated, has a [[ground state]] along with an infinite series of higher-energy [[excited state]]s.]]
The principal motivation for quasiparticles is that it is almost impossible to ''directly'' describe every particle in a macroscopic system. For example, a barely-visible (0.1mm) grain of sand contains around 10<sup>17</sup> nuclei and 10<sup>18</sup> electrons. Each of these attracts or repels every other by [[Coulomb's law]]. In [[quantum mechanics]], a system is described by a wavefunction, which, if the particles are interacting (as they are in our case), depends on the position of every particle in the system. So, each particle adds three independent variables to the wavefunction, one for each coordinate needed to describe the position of that particle. Because of this, directly approaching the many-body problem of 10<sup>18</sup> interacting electrons by straightforwardly trying to solve the appropriate [[Schrödinger equation]] is impossible in practice, since it amounts to solving a [[partial differential equation]] not just in three dimensions, but in 3x10<sup>18</sup> dimensions – one for each component of the position of each particle.

One simplifying factor is that the system as a whole, like any quantum system, has a [[ground state]] and various [[excited state]]s with higher and higher energy above the ground state. In many contexts, only the "low-lying" excited states, with energy reasonably close to the ground state, are relevant. This occurs because of the [[Boltzmann distribution]], which implies that very-high-energy [[thermal fluctuations]] are unlikely to occur at any given temperature.

Quasiparticles and collective excitations are a type of low-lying excited state. For example, a crystal at [[absolute zero]] is in the [[ground state]], but if one [[phonon]] is added to the crystal (in other words, if the crystal is made to vibrate slightly at a particular frequency) then the crystal is now in a low-lying excited state. The single phonon is called an ''elementary excitation''. More generally, low-lying excited states may contain any number of elementary excitations (for example, many phonons, along with other quasiparticles and collective excitations).<ref>''Principles of Nanophotonics'' by Motoichi Ohtsu, p205 [https://books.google.com/books?id=3za2u8FnCgUC&pg=PA205 google books link]</ref>

When the material is characterized as having "several elementary excitations", this statement presupposes that the different excitations can be combined together. In other words, it presupposes that the excitations can coexist simultaneously and independently. This is never ''exactly'' true. For example, a solid with two identical phonons does not have exactly twice the excitation energy of a solid with just one phonon, because the crystal vibration is slightly [[anharmonic]]. However, in many materials, the elementary excitations are very ''close'' to being independent. Therefore, as a ''starting point'', they are treated as free, independent entities, and then corrections are included via interactions between the elementary excitations, such as "phonon-phonon [[scattering]]".

Therefore, using quasiparticles / collective excitations, instead of analyzing 10<sup>18</sup> particles, one needs to deal with only a handful of somewhat-independent elementary excitations. It is, therefore, a very effective approach to simplify the [[many-body problem]] in quantum mechanics. This approach is not useful for ''all'' systems, however: In [[strongly correlated material]]s, the elementary excitations are so far from being independent that it is not even useful as a starting point to treat them as independent.

===Distinction between quasiparticles and collective excitations===
Usually, an elementary excitation is called a "quasiparticle" if it is a [[fermion]] and a "collective excitation" if it is a [[boson]].<ref name="Kaxiras" /> However, the precise distinction is not universally agreed upon.<ref name="Mattuck" />

There is a difference in the way that quasiparticles and collective excitations are intuitively envisioned.<ref name=Mattuck/> A quasiparticle is usually thought of as being like a [[dressed particle]]: It is built around a real particle at its "core", but the behavior of the particle is affected by the environment. A standard example is the "electron quasiparticle": A real electron particle, in a crystal, behaves as if it had a [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|different mass]]. On the other hand, a collective excitation is usually imagined to be a reflection of the aggregate behavior of the system, with no single real particle at its "core". A standard example is the [[phonon]], which characterizes the vibrational motion of every atom in the crystal.

However, these two visualizations leave some ambiguity. For example, a [[magnon]] in a [[ferromagnet]] can be considered in one of two perfectly equivalent ways: (a) as a mobile defect (a misdirected spin) in a perfect alignment of magnetic moments or (b) as a quantum of a collective [[spin wave]] that involves the precession of many spins. In the first case, the magnon is envisioned as a quasiparticle, in the second case, as a collective excitation. However, both (a) and (b) are equivalent and correct descriptions. As this example shows, the intuitive distinction between a quasiparticle and a collective excitation is not particularly important or fundamental.

The problems arising from the collective nature of quasiparticles have also been discussed within the philosophy of science, notably in relation to the identity conditions of quasiparticles and whether they should be considered "real" by the standards of, for example, [[entity realism]].<ref>A. Gelfert, 'Manipulative Success and the Unreal', ''International Studies in the Philosophy of Science'' Vol. 17, 2003, 245–263</ref><ref>B. Falkenburg, ''Particle Metaphysics'' (The Frontiers Collection), Berlin: Springer 2007, esp. pp. 243–46</ref>

===Effect on bulk properties===

By investigating the properties of individual quasiparticles, it is possible to obtain a great deal of information about low-energy systems, including the [[quantum fluid|flow properties]] and [[heat capacity]].

In the heat capacity example, a crystal can store energy by forming [[phonon]]s, and/or forming [[exciton]]s, and/or forming [[plasmon]]s, etc. Each of these is a separate contribution to the overall heat capacity.

===History===

The idea of quasiparticles originated in [[Lev Davidovich Landau|Lev Landau's]] theory of [[Fermi liquid]]s, which was originally invented for studying liquid [[helium-3]]. For these systems a strong similarity exists between the notion of quasiparticle and [[dressed particle]]s in [[quantum field theory]]. The dynamics of Landau's theory is defined by a [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic equation]] of the [[Mean field theory|mean-field type]]. A similar equation, the [[Vlasov equation]], is valid for a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] in the so-called [[plasma approximation]]. In the plasma approximation, charged particles are considered to be moving in the electromagnetic field collectively generated by all other particles, and hard [[collision]]s between the charged particles are neglected. When a kinetic equation of the mean-field type is a valid first-order description of a system, second-order corrections determine the [[entropy]] production, and generally take the form of a [[Boltzmann equation|Boltzmann]]-type collision term, in which figure only "far collisions" between virtual particles. In other words, every type of mean-field kinetic equation, and in fact every [[mean-field theory]], involves a quasiparticle concept.

==Examples of quasiparticles and collective excitations==
This section contains examples of quasiparticles and collective excitations. The first subsection below contains common ones that occur in a wide variety of materials under ordinary conditions; the second subsection contains examples that arise only in special contexts.

===More common examples===
{{see also|List of quasiparticles}}
*In solids, an '''electron quasiparticle''' is an [[electron]] as affected by the other forces and interactions in the solid. The electron quasiparticle has the same [[electric charge|charge]] and [[spin (physics)|spin]] as a "normal" ([[elementary particle]]) electron, and like a normal electron, it is a [[fermion]]. However, its mass can differ substantially from that of a normal electron; see the article [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]].<ref name="Kaxiras">E. Kaxiras, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ULXZwEJeElYC ''Atomic and Electronic Structure of Solids''], {{ISBN|0-521-52339-7}}, pages 65–69.</ref> Its electric field is also modified, as a result of [[electric field screening]]. In many other respects, especially in metals under ordinary conditions, these so-called Landau quasiparticles{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} closely resemble familiar electrons; as [[Michael F. Crommie|Crommie's]] "[[quantum corral]]" showed, an [[Scanning tunneling microscope|STM]] can clearly image their [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] upon scattering.
*A '''[[electron hole|hole]]''' is a quasiparticle consisting of the lack of an electron in a state; it is most commonly used in the context of empty states in the [[valence band]] of a [[semiconductor]].<ref name="Kaxiras"/> A hole has the opposite charge of an electron.
*A '''[[phonon]]''' is a collective excitation associated with the vibration of atoms in a rigid [[crystal structure]]. It is a [[quantum]] of a [[sound wave]].
*A '''[[magnon]]''' is a collective excitation<ref name=Kaxiras/> associated with the electrons' spin structure in a crystal lattice. It is a quantum of a [[spin wave]].
*In materials, a '''photon''' quasiparticle is a [[photon]] as affected by its interactions with the material. In particular, the photon quasiparticle has a modified relation between wavelength and energy ([[dispersion relation]]), as described by the material's [[index of refraction]]. It may also be termed a '''[[polariton]]''', especially near a resonance of the material. For example, an '''exciton-polariton''' is a superposition of an exciton and a photon; a '''phonon-polariton''' is a superposition of a phonon and a photon.
*A '''[[plasmon]]''' is a collective excitation, which is the quantum of [[plasma oscillation]]s (wherein all the electrons simultaneously oscillate with respect to all the ions).
*A '''[[polaron]]''' is a quasiparticle which comes about when an electron interacts with the [[polarization density|polarization]] of its surrounding ions.
*An '''[[exciton]]''' is an electron and hole bound together.
*A '''plasmariton''' is a coupled optical phonon and dressed photon consisting of a plasmon and photon.

===More specialized examples===
*A '''[[roton]]''' is a collective excitation associated with the rotation of a fluid (often a [[superfluid]]). It is a quantum of a [[vortex]].

First, their charge can be less than the [[elementary charge|electron charge]] ''e''.

*'''[[Stoner excitation]]s''' in ferromagnetic metals
*'''[[Bogoliubov quasiparticle]]s''' in superconductors. [[Superconductivity]] is carried by [[Cooper pairs]]—usually described as pairs of electrons—that move through the crystal lattice without resistance. A broken Cooper pair is called a Bogoliubov quasiparticle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.llnl.gov/str/Labov.html|title=Josephson Junctions|work=Science and Technology Review|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}}</ref> It differs from the conventional quasiparticle in metal because it combines the properties of a negatively charged electron and a positively charged hole (an electron void). Physical objects like impurity atoms, from which quasiparticles scatter in an ordinary metal, only weakly affect the energy of a Cooper pair in a conventional superconductor. In conventional superconductors, interference between Bogoliubov quasiparticles is tough for an STM to see. Because of their complex global electronic structures, however, high-Tc cuprate superconductors are another matter. Thus Davis and his colleagues were able to resolve distinctive patterns of quasiparticle interference in Bi-2212.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=J. E.
