'''Pioneer Place''' is an upscale, urban [[shopping mall]] in downtown [[Portland, Oregon]]. It consists of four blocks of retail, dining, parking, and an office tower named '''Pioneer Tower'''. The mall itself is spread out between four buildings, interconnected by [[skywalk]]s or underground mall sections. The footprint of the entire complex consists of four full city blocks, bisected by SW Yamhill and Fourth, bounded north-south by SW Morrison and Taylor Streets and east-west by SW Third and Fifth Avenues.<ref name=directory>[http://www.pioneerplace.com/directory Directory.] Pioneer Place.

==History==
[[File:Portland July 2017 34 (Pioneer Place).jpg|thumb|left|Exterior of Pioneer Place]]

Pioneer Place I began construction in the late 1980s and opened in 1990. <ref>{{cite book| title=Breakthroughs Re-creating the American City| url=http://www.brunerfoundation.org/rba/pdfs/1989/03_chapter2-Portland.PDF| last1=Peirce| first1=Neal I.| last2=Guskind| first2=Robert| publisher=Bruner Foundation, Inc.| year=1993| pages=63-64| isbn=0-88285-145-4}}</ref>

The development was built in two phases, the names of which are reflected in the names of the two main mall buildings. Pioneer Place I, or The "Atrium Shops"/Zone A, opened in 1990 and was developed with assistance from the [[Portland Development Commission]].<ref name=changes>{{cite news| last=Culverwell| first=Wendy| title=Changes afoot for Pioneer Place| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2012/01/19/changes-afoot-for-pioneer-place.html| accessdate=1 September 2012| newspaper=[[American City Business Journals|Portland Business Journal]]| date=January 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Portland Development Commission chief resigns|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/1997/05/26/daily4.html|accessdate=1 September 2012|newspaper=Portland Business Journal|date=May 28, 1997}}</ref> Pioneer Place II, or The "Rotunda Shops"/Zone B, is located across Fourth Avenue to the east. Construction on Pioneer Place II began in 1998, and at the time was to add {{convert|150000|ft2}} at a cost of around $60 million.<ref>{{cite news| last=Miller|first=Brian K.|title=Pioneer Place addition's construction under way|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/1998/05/18/newscolumn1.html|accessdate=1 September 2012| newspaper=Portland Business Journal| date=May 17, 1998}}</ref>

[[Saks Fifth Avenue]] closed its store at the mall in 2010, with [[H&M]] taking over the portion that had been Saks men's store later that year.<ref>{{cite news| last=Balas| first=Monique| title=H&M arrives, Movie Gallery sinks| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/print-edition/2011/01/14/hm-arrives-movie-gallery-sinks.html| accessdate=1 September 2012| newspaper=Portland Business Journal| date=January 14, 2011}}</ref> The remaining parts of the Saks footprint was demolished in 2012 to make way for a new [[Apple Store]] and a [[Yard House]] restaurant.<ref>{{cite news| last=Culverwell| first=Wendy| title=Ex-Saks store to give way to Yard House, Apple|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2012/08/30/ex-saks-store-to-give-way-to-yard.html|accessdate=1 September 2012| newspaper=Portland Business Journal| date=August 30, 2012}}</ref>
