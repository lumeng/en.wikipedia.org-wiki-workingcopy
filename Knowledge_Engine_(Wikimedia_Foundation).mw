<!-- Reason for Being and Development -->
'''Knowledge Engine''' ('''KE''') is a [[search engine]] project initiated in 2015 by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] (WMF) to locate and display verifiable and trustworthy information on the Internet.<ref name=Koebler2016/><ref name=Mishra2016/> The goal of the KE is to be less reliant on traditional search engines.<ref name=McGee2016/> The KE aims to change the behavior of readers to stay on Wikipedia.org and other [[Outline of Wikipedia#Wikipedia-related projects|Wikipedia-related projects]] rather than return to their favorite search engines to find additional information.<ref name=McGee2016/> According to the WMF, the KE will protect user privacy, be open and transparent about how a piece of information originates, and allow access to [[metadata]].<ref name=Singh2016/> WMF's application for a $250,000 grant from the [[Knight Foundation]] describes KE as an alternative to for-profit Internet access to information: "Commercial search engines dominate search-engine use of the Internet, and they're employing proprietary technologies to consolidate channels of access to the Internet’s knowledge and information."<ref name=Cuthbertson2016/> The project comprises four stages, each scheduled to take about 18 months.<ref name=Crum2016/> The project's cost could run into the tens of millions.<ref name=Sentance2016/>

<!-- Function and purpose -->
KE will draw information from Wikipedia-related projects and may eventually search other sources of public information such as the [[U.S. Census Bureau]].<ref name=Cuthbertson2016/> Leaked internal WMF documents stated the "Knowledge Engine By Wikipedia will democratize the discovery of media, news and information—it will make the Internet's most relevant information more accessible and openly curated, and it will create an open data engine that's completely free of commercial interests. Our new site will be the Internet’s first transparent search engine, and the first one that carries the reputation of Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation."<ref name=Koebler2016/> KE is not intended to compete with [[Google Search]] as a universal search engine, says WMF.<ref name=Cuthbertson2016/> Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] allowed that the KE might in time also include academic and [[open access]] sources in its [[Search engine results page|search results]].<ref name=Greis2016/> Matt Southern in ''Search Engine Journal'' attributed media confusion about KE's scope to the fact that this was "quite a contrast to the original grant application documents".<ref name=Southern2016/> As of mid-February 2016, the WMF is developing an internal search engine for Wikipedia-related projects.<ref name=Sentance2016/>

<!-- Controversy -->
Generally, large-scale WMF projects such as KE are discussed publicly with the [[Wikipedia community]], but this did not happen with the KE project.<ref name=Vincent2016/> The Wikipedia community volunteers stated the secrecy around the KE project was at odds with WMF's transparency values.<ref name=Koebler2016/> The KE project was not published in the WMF's publicly available annual plan.<ref name=McCormick2016/> In a text posted on the [[English Wikipedia]]'s community newsletter, ''[[The Signpost]]'', [[James Heilman]], who was dismissed from the WMF's [[wmf:Board of Trustees#Current members|Board of Trustees]] in December 2015, said he had insisted multiple times that the Knight Foundation grant documentation be made public, without success,<ref name=Tual2016/> and suggested that his push for transparency concerning the grant had been a factor in his dismissal—a suggestion rejected by Jimmy Wales.<ref name=Koebler2016/> Critics say the project's roll out illustrates a disconnect and lack of understanding between a foundation that's increasingly run by people connected with [[Silicon Valley]], and the volunteer community of editors who worry that KE may reflect a change in the WMF's focus from [[user-generated content]] to one led by automated data results.<ref name=Koebler2016/>

An initial blogpost published by the WMF Executive Director [[Lila Tretikov]] and the WMF regarding the KE project still did not adequately explain why the original grant application documents appeared so much larger than merely developing an internal search engine.<ref name=Hern2016/> Tretikov’s employees said the WMF was still not being straightforward with the Wikipedia community.<ref name=Koebler--2016/> Ariel Glenn, WMF's "tech gnome", said it’s "not just about an [Executive Director]."<ref name=Church2016/> Caitlyn Virtue, WMF’s Director of Development, said "This is bad, and not just bad for our relationship with Knight. It’s clear that leadership did not follow our own movements’ best practices."<ref name=Church2016/> WMF Executive Director Tretikov resigned on February 25, 2016, as a result of the controversy.<ref name=Hern2016/><ref name=Spiegel2016/> Former Deputy Director of the WMF [[Erik Möller]] described the recent events as "a crisis."<ref name=Sentance2016/>

==Reason for being==
[[File:Google Knowledge Panel.png|right|alt=A screenshot of Google Knowledge with fast facts from a Wikipedia article.|thumb|Since mid-2012,<ref name=Orlowski2014/> [[Google Search]] has included fast facts from Wikipedia articles on its [[Search engine results page|search results]] pages<ref name=Koebler2016/> via the [[Google Knowledge Graph]].<ref name=Orlowski2014/>]]
The Knowledge Engine (KE) project is being developed to help send traffic to [[Wikipedia]].<ref name=Koebler--2016/> "Traffic to Wikipedia coming from Google has fallen as Google has begun incorporating fast facts from Wikipedia articles onto the front page of Google," according to Motherboard.<ref name=Koebler2016/> Since that information originated from Wikipedia, it can be considered as part of Wikipedia's aim to expand public knowledge; however, users being able to access Wikipedia data without actually visiting Wikipedia may be seen as a threat to donations that come from readers who visit the site.<ref name=Koebler2016/> Although the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] (WMF) may not be attempting to create a general web search engine or another [[Google Search]], the goal of KE is to be less reliant on traditional search engines.<ref name=McGee2016/> The KE aims to change the behavior of readers by having them stay on Wikipedia.org and other [[Outline of Wikipedia#Wikipedia-related projects|Wikipedia-related projects]] rather than return to their favorite search engines to find additional information.<ref name=McGee2016/>

The [[Knight Foundation]] grant agreement questions, "Would users go to Wikipedia if it were an open channel beyond an encyclopedia?"<ref name=Sentance2016/> According to [[Search Engine Watch]], by making Wikipedia or Wikipedia's KE a leading site for the world’s knowledge, Wikipedia could be able to recoup the traffic it had lost to Google.<ref name=Sentance2016/> The KE project could change Wikipedia.org to a site that is more similar to a [[search engine]] than an [[online encyclopedia]].<ref name=McGee2016/>

According to ''[[Vice (magazine)#Website|Vice]]'', "the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that finances and founded Wikipedia, is interested in creating a search engine that appears squarely aimed at competing with Google."<ref name=Koebler2016/> According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', "there was considerable doubt over what the tool was actually intended to be: a search engine aimed at halting a decline in Wikipedia traffic sent by Google, or simply a service for searching within Wikipedia?"<ref name=Hern2016/> According to Search Engine Watch, "Wikimedia is still in a very real battle with Google for the attention and clicks of users who are seeking information online."<ref name=Sentance2016/>

==Development==
Seemingly out of line with WMF's usual "radical transparency", information about the project only became public gradually.<ref name=Koebler2016/> As early as May 2015, community members had asked questions about the concentration of staff in a new "Search and Discovery" department, even though public plans made little or no reference to this work.<ref name=Koebler2016/><ref name=Kleinz2016/> The WMF was awarded a $250,000 grant for the project in September 2015 from the Knight Foundation, which was publicly announced in a January 2016 press release.<ref name=McGee2016/> A budget submitted by the WMF included in the grant press release gave $3,421,672 to cover costs, but the WMF acknowledged it had only received $250,000 in financing as of mid-February 2016.<ref name=RA2016>{{cite news |url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2016-02-15/knowledge-engine-wikimedia-foundation-takes-aim-at-google-with-us25m-search-project/1547924|title=Knowledge Engine: Wikimedia Foundation takes aim at Google with $US2.5m search project|date=February 17, 2016 |publisher=[[Radio Australia]]}}</ref>

The WMF initially published only portions of the grant documentation,<ref name=Orlowski-2016/> but eventually made the grant agreement available on February 11, 2016,<ref name=Tual2016/> and further internal documents were leaked shortly after.<ref name=Koebler2016/><ref name=Vincent2016/> The project comprises four stages, each scheduled to take about 18 months: Discovery, Advisory, Community and Extension.<ref name=Crum2016>{{cite news|url=http://www.webpronews.com/knowledge-engine-wikipedia-works-on-new-search-engine-2016-02/|title=Wikimedia Works On Search Improvements, Says It's Not Competing with Google [Updated]|last=Crum|first=Chris|date=February 15, 2016 |work=WebProNews}}</ref> The initial stage of the project is budgeted to cost $2.5 million,<ref name=Orlowski2016/> potentially running into the tens of millions.<ref name=Sentance2016/> After a year, the WMF will evaluate the development and at the close of the grant, the team will have set the plans for the project to continue to the second stage, according to the grant document.<ref name=Crum2016/> It will take at least six years to complete, says WMF.<ref name=Koebler2016/> According to the grant document, the heads of the team were listed as [[Lila Tretikov]], Wes Moran and Tomasz Finc.<ref name=Kleinman2016>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35668352|title=Wikimedia head resigns over 'search engine' row|last=Zoe|first=Kleinman |date=February 26, 2016 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>

==Function and purpose==
[[File:Discovery_Year_0-1-2_page_9.pdf|right|alt=A screenshot of potential sources used by the Knowledge Engine.|thumb|350px|Example of federated data sources potentially used by the Knowledge Engine.]]
KE will be open and transparent about how a piece of information originates and allow access to [[metadata]], says WMF.<ref name=Singh2016/> It will also have no advertisements, protect user privacy, and emphasize community building and sharing of information.<ref name=Singh2016/> KE will draw information from Wikipedia-related projects and may eventually search other sources of public information such as the [[U.S. Census Bureau]],<ref name=Cuthbertson2016/> [[OpenStreetMap]],<ref name=Shah2016>{{cite news|first=Jaymi|last=Shah|title=Wikimedia Foundation Secures $250,000 Grant For Search Engine Development|url=http://technoledger.com/wikipedia-receives-250k-grant-for-search-engine/|work=Technoledger|date=February 16, 2016}}</ref> the [[Digital Public Library of America]],<ref name=Kleinz2016/> and external sources like Fox News.<ref name=Sentance2016/> Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] and the WMF stated that KE will focus on improving search on Wikipedia and related Wikimedia projects.<ref name=Koebler2016/>

There was extensive debate in respect to what the KE actually is, due to WMF’s public statements differing from the leaked internal documents.<ref name=Koebler2016/> The leaked internal documents contradicted statements by Jimmy Wales and other Board members.<ref name=Mullin2016>{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/head-of-wikimedia-foundation-resigns-as-tensions-with-editors-mount/|title=Wikimedia Foundation director resigns after uproar over “Knowledge Engine”|last=Mullin|first=Joe|date=February 29, 2016|work=[[Ars Technica]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301082152/http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/head-of-wikimedia-foundation-resigns-as-tensions-with-editors-mount/|archivedate=March  1, 2016|df=}}</ref> Leaked internal WMF documents stated the "Knowledge Engine By Wikipedia will democratize the discovery of media, news and information—it will make the Internet's most relevant information more accessible and openly curated, and it will create an open data engine that's completely free of commercial interests.

KE is not intended to compete with Google Search as a universal search engine, says WMF.<ref name=Cuthbertson2016/> Jimmy Wales stated that suggestions that the WMF is creating a rival to Google are "trolling", "completely and utterly false", and "a total lie".<ref name=Koebler2016/><ref name=Tual2016/> The grant application states that it will "create a model for surfacing high quality, public information on the internet."<ref name=Koebler2016/> It also advises that "commercial search engines dominate search-engine use of the internet" and states that "Google, Yahoo, or another big commercial search engine could suddenly devote resources to a similar project, which could reduce the success of the project."<ref name=Koebler2016/> Wales allowed that the KE might in time also include academic and [[open access]] sources in its [[Search engine results page|search results]].<ref name=Greis2016>{{cite news|url=http://www.golem.de/news/knowledge-engine-wirbel-um-angebliche-wikipedia-konkurrenz-zu-google-1602-119167.html|language=German|title=Wirbel um angebliche Wikipedia-Konkurrenz zu Google|last=Greis|first=Friedhelm|date=February 15, 2016 |work=Golem.de}}</ref>

In response to media speculation, the WMF published a response clarifying its intentions: "What are we not doing? We're not building a global crawler search engine [...] Despite headlines, we are not trying to compete with other platforms, including Google. As a non-profit we are noncommercial and support open knowledge. Our focus is on the knowledge contributed on the Wikimedia projects.

==Controversy==
{{quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right |halig=left | salign=right|quote="Many in the community were furious that details of such a large project had been withheld by an organization that prides itself on radical transparency. Wikimedia’s public story—that it was never working on a search engine—was directly contradicted by a grant proposal made to the Knight Foundation and leaked internal documents."|source=&nbsp;—Jason Koebler, ''[[Vice (magazine)#Website|Vice]]''<ref name=Koebler--2016/>}}
Ruth McCambridge said in ''Nonprofit Quarterly'', "Wikipedia editors have been requesting from December for the grant proposal and grant letter for a project that many surmise is a bid to remain technologically cutting-edge by the Wikimedia Foundation, but which may divert resources and attention from other pressing needs of the community."<ref name=McCambridge2016/> Generally, large-scale WMF projects such as KE are discussed publicly with the [[Wikipedia community]], but this did not happen with the KE project<ref name=Vincent2016/> as Wikipedia community volunteers were initially unaware of the existence of the KE.<ref name=Koebler2016/><ref name=ABCNewsAustralia2016/> Many Wikipedians expressed outrage at what they perceived to be the secrecy around the KE project and their lack of ability to give input, according to the [[English Wikipedia]]'s community newsletter, ''[[The Signpost]]''.<ref name=McCambridge2016/> The lack of community involvement raised questions about WMF's commitment to transparency with the Wikipedia community.<ref name=Vincent2016/> Wikipedia editors noted that the KE project was not published in the WMF's publicly available annual plan.<ref name=McCormick2016>{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/26/11118326/wikimedia-head-resigns-search-engine|title=Wikimedia head resigns after leak exposed search engine plans|last=McCormick|first=Rich|date=February 26, 2016 |work=[[The Verge]]}}</ref>

Commenting on the WMF's Executive Director [[Lila Tretikov]]'s reluctance to post the donor documents to the volunteer community, referencing privacy concerns, McCambridge sees "a major difference in culture and values assumptions" compared to previous Wikimedia practice.<ref name=McCambridge2016/> McCambridge said that "the power of important strategic decisions" now rests "between funders and the top of the organizational hierarchy" and is "not shared with volunteer editors."<ref name=McCambridge2016/> [[James Heilman]], who was dismissed from the WMF's [[wmf:Board of Trustees#Current members|Board of Trustees]] in late 2015, said that while on the Board, he had pushed for greater transparency of the [[Knight Foundation]] grant documentation and its financing,<ref name=Noisette2016/> and suggested that his push for transparency concerning the grant had been a factor in his dismissal – a suggestion Jimmy Wales rejected as "utter fucking bullshit".<ref name=Koebler2016/> Tretikov eventually released the Knight Foundation grant in February 2016 which disclosed the first stage of the KE project.<ref name=McCambridge2016/> Tretikov said that she regretted being so late in informing the Wikipedia editing community about the Knight Foundation grant.<ref name=Kleinz2016/> In a "Discovery" meeting held on February 16, 2016, regardless of Design Manager Moiz Syed’s concerns in relation to all of the "bad press" with regard to Tretikov’s hazy approach to a foundation based on transparency, Tretikov said that "the press is wrong on issues, not necessarily bad."<ref name=Church2016/>

Longtime Wikipedia editor and journalist William Beutler told ''[[Vice (magazine)#Website|Vice Magazine]]'''s Jason Koebler, "Leaving aside whether a search engine is a good idea, let alone feasible, the core issue here is about transparency. The irony is that the Wikimedia Foundation failed to observe one of the movement's own core values [...]."<ref name=Koebler-2016>{{cite news |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/wikimedia-were-really-really-not-building-a-search-engine |title=Wikimedia: We’re Really Really Not Building a Search Engine |last=Koebler |first=Jason |date=February 16, 2016 |work=[[Vice (magazine)#Website|Vice]]}}</ref> A UK Wikipedia editor [[Ashley van Haeften]] told ''[[Ars Technica]]'' via e-mail that "Lila, Jimmy, and the rest chose to keep the project and the Knight Foundation application and grant a secret until the projects were underway for six months, and even then this only came to light because it was leaked."<ref name=Mullin2016/> Critics say the project's roll out illustrates a disconnect and lack of understanding between a foundation that's increasingly run by people connected with [[Silicon Valley]], and the volunteer community of editors who worry that KE may reflect a change in the WMF's focus from [[user-generated content]] to one led by automated data results.<ref name=Koebler2016/>

After the leaked documents, many on the Wikimedia-L mailing list were calling for Tretikov’s resignation.<ref name=Koebler--2016/> The initial blogpost published by Tretikov and the WMF regarding the KE project still did not adequately explain why the original grant application documents appeared so much larger than merely developing an internal search engine.<ref name=Hern2016/> After that blogpost, calls for Tretikov’s resignation heightened, because her employees said the WMF still was not being straightforward with the Wikipedia community.<ref name=Koebler--2016/> "My concern is that we still aren’t communicating it clearly enough. This morning’s blog post is the truth, but not all of the truth. Namely that we had big plans in the past. It would have been much easier to say that we did have big plans, but they were ditched … there is clear evidence of something, but we still haven’t acknowledged it. We can’t deny it", Max Semenik, a Discovery team member explained to Tretikov, according to statements posted of an internal meeting on the WMF’s website.<ref name=Koebler--2016/>

On the Wikimedia-L mailing list to the WMF's Board of Trustees, Ariel Glenn, WMF's "tech gnome", portrayed the current organization situation as "toxic".<ref name=Church2016/> The post appealed with "the one organization that has the ability to stop it, to step in and do so."<ref name=Church2016/> Glenn's list of concerns include "bad hirings, decisions in secret, dissembling and coverups about the processes that led to those decisions; refusal or inability to state a clear vision, let alone get buy-in or the involvement of staff/community in shaping that vision; restructuring the organization following these same broken processes," though it’s "not just about an [Executive Director]."<ref name=Church2016/> Caitlyn Virtue, WMF’s Director of Development, said "This is bad, and not just bad for our relationship with Knight.
