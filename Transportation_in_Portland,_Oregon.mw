Like [[Transportation in the United States|transportation in the rest of the United States]], the primary mode of local '''transportation in Portland, Oregon''' is the [[automobile]]. The [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro]] has a regional master plan in which [[transit-oriented development]] plays a major role.<ref>http://library.oregonmetro.gov/files//tod_final_report.pdf</ref>  This approach, part of the [[new urbanism]], promotes mixed-use and high-density development around [[light rail]] stops and [[List of TriMet transit centers|transit centers]], and the investment of the metropolitan area's share of federal tax dollars into multiple modes of [[transport]]ation.  In the United States, this focus is atypical in an era when [[automobile]] use led many areas to neglect their core cities in favor of development along [[interstate highway]]s, in [[suburb]]s, and [[satellite city|satellite cities]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Focus: Portland; So Long Cars, Hello People |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/31/realestate/focus-portland-so-long-cars-hello-people.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Timothy Egan |date=May 31, 1987 |accessdate=July 31, 2012}}</ref>

==Mass transit==
Portland has a comprehensive [[public transportation]] system. The bus and rail system is operated by [[TriMet]], its name reflecting the three [[Portland metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] counties it serves ([[Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah]], [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas]], and [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington]]).  Portland's rate of public transit use (12.6% of commutes in 2008) is comparable to much larger cities like [[Los Angeles]], and higher than in most similarly sized U.S. cities, but is lower than in some others, such as [[Baltimore]] and [[Seattle]].<ref name="ACS2008">{{cite web

[[File:Portland Transit Mall with cyclists crossing.jpg|thumb|left|Buses and bikes in downtown Portland.]]
Within the [[Downtown Portland|downtown area]] (the city center) is the [[Portland Transit Mall]], a transit-priority corridor on which buses and light rail trains from many different parts of the region converge.  First opened in 1977, and for three decades served only by buses, the transit mall underwent major changes in 2009.  Tracks for light rail ([[MAX Light Rail|MAX]]) were added, bus stops spaced farther apart, and the left lane opened to general traffic (but with right turns prohibited).<ref>{{cite news

From 1975 to 2010, all of downtown Portland was in [[Fareless Square]], a fare zone within which all rides on buses, light rail and streetcars were [[Zero-fare public transport|fare-free]], and starting in 2001 this zone also covered a portion of the adjacent [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]].  In 2010, free rides became limited to light-rail and streetcar service&nbsp;– no longer covering bus service&nbsp;– and the zone was renamed the "Free Rail Zone".<ref name="fareless ends">{{cite news|title=Better have that bus fare today; Fareless Square ends|date=January 4, 2010|newspaper=[[Portland Tribune]]|url=http://thetribonline.net/news/story.php?story_id=126254730469693400 | accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref> In September 2012, the fareless zone was discontinued entirely, due to a $12&nbsp;million shortfall in TriMet's annual budget.<ref name=oreg-2012aug>{{cite news|last=Bailey Jr.|first=Everton|title=TriMet boosts most fares starting Saturday; some routes changing |newspaper=The Oregonian|date=August 30, 2012 <!--print edition date Aug 31, 2012, page 1-->|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/roadreport/index.ssf/2012/08/trimet_boosts_most_fares_start.html |accessdate=September 1, 2012}}</ref>

Ben Holladay was the first person to offer public transportation to the city of Portland when in 1872 he opened the [[Portland Street Railway Company]], a [[horsecar]] line on First Street extending to a garage at the end of Glisan.<ref name=labbe>{{cite book|last=Labbe|first=John T.|title=Fares, Please!

Horsecars took passengers across the river and [[steam train]]s took them further into the suburbs,<ref>Labbe, pp. 20–21</ref> but both modes were soon replaced by [[Tram|electric streetcar]] lines, the first of which began operation on November 1, 1889, between [[St. Johns, Portland, Oregon|St. Johns]] and Portland.<ref name="oreg1889nov2">"Cars Running By Electricity; Formal Opening of the Portland–St. John's Line Yesterday".

===Buses===
TriMet operates a fleet of 610 buses on a network of 80 bus routes.<ref name="TriMet-glance-2015">{{cite web | url = http://trimet.org/pdfs/publications/TriMet-At-a-Glance-2015.pdf | title = TriMet At-a-Glance | publisher = TriMet | page = 6 | year = February 2015 | format = PDF | accessdate = February 24, 2016}}</ref>  Twelve of the routes are designated "Frequent Service" bus routes, with more frequent schedules than other routes.<ref name=overview-2014>{{cite web|title=TriMet-At-a-Glance 2014|format=PDF|date=February 2014|publisher=TriMet |url=http://trimet.org/pdfs/publications/TriMet-At-a-Glance-2014.pdf |accessdate=2014-09-10}}</ref>  Originally intended to have buses scheduled every 15 minutes or less all day, every day (including weekends and holidays), budget cutbacks in 2009 caused TriMet to change "Frequent Service" routes to have 15-minute-or-less wait times only during weekday peak usage times in the morning and afternoon.<ref name=frequent_service>{{cite web| publisher = TriMet|title = Frequent Service| url = http://trimet.org/schedules/frequentservice.htm| accessdate = September 9, 2014}}</ref>  In August 2014, TriMet reintroduced 15-minutes-or-less wait times at all times during weekdays on Frequent Service routes, with the stated goal of reinstating weekend 15-minutes-or-less wait times on these routes.<ref name=frequent_service/>

TriMet's bus fleet is made up of 30' and 40' buses, built in 1997 or later, and nearly all are low-floor buses, with only a small number of older high-floor models (built in 1997) still in service at the end of 2015.  The last non-air-conditioned buses were retired in December 2015.<ref name="year in review 2015">{{cite web|title=The Year in Review: 2015|url=http://howweroll.trimet.org/2015/12/31/the-year-in-review-2015/|date=December 31, 2015|work=How We Roll|publisher=TriMet|accessdate=2016-02-24}}</ref> In 2012, TriMet reinstated its annual bus purchase program and will have only low-floor buses in rotation by 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=The first batch of 70 new buses rolls into service Tuesday, July 23|url=http://news.trimet.org/2013/07/the-first-batch-of-70-new-buses-rolls-into-service-tuesday-july-23/|publisher=TriMet|date=July 22, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}</ref>

TriMet's bus routes also include express buses from downtown Portland to South Beaverton, Sherwood and Oregon City, and express buses from Marquam Hill to Beaverton, Tigard, Southwest Portland, and Milwaukie.  TriMet also has several "cross-town" routes that do not serve downtown Portland.  The bus network operates predominately in a hub-and-spoke network starting with the downtown Portland transit mall, and includes outlying [[List of TriMet transit centers|transit centers]] in Portland's suburbs.

In addition to the fixed-route service, TriMet operates a [[paratransit]] service known as LIFT which operates 254 minibuses and 15 sedans offering door-to-door service for citizens who cannot access regular TriMet services.<ref name=overview-2014/>

Since September 2015, Portland's [[light rail]] system, named [[MAX Light Rail|''MAX'']] (short for Metropolitan Area Express), consists of five color-coded lines:
* The [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] is a {{convert|33|mi|adj=on}} east-west route. It begins in [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], a western suburb, passes through [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]] and [[downtown Portland]], then across the Willamette River, through Northeast Portland and east to the city of [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]].  The {{convert|15|mi|adj=on}} line between downtown and Gresham was the first light rail line opened in Portland, in 1986.  MAX lines first became designated by colors in 2000.
* The [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]] incorporates a {{convert|5.6|mi|adj=on}} north-south addition between [[Portland International Airport|the airport]] and the [[Gateway/Northeast 99th Avenue Transit Center (MAX station)|Gateway Transit Center]] near the northeast Portland [[Parkrose, Portland, Oregon|neighborhood of Parkrose]]. From that point the line overlaps the Blue Line, running west to downtown and beyond, terminating at the [[Beaverton Transit Center]], where it and the Blue Line meet [[WES Commuter Rail]].
* The [[MAX Yellow Line|Yellow Line]] added {{convert|5.8|mi}} to the system. It connects North Portland's [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Expo Center]] with downtown. This line is often referred to as "Interstate MAX" because much of it runs along Interstate Avenue, and parallel to [[Interstate 5|I-5]].  Until 2009, the Yellow Line followed the same mostly east-west alignment through downtown Portland as used by the Blue and Red lines, traveling along Morrison Street (westbound) and Yamhill Street (eastbound) through the core of the business district.  However, on August 30, 2009, the Yellow Line shifted to a new north-south alignment through downtown that had been constructed along the [[Portland Transit Mall|Portland Mall]] (see Green Line).<ref>{{cite web| title = MAX Yellow Line: Route and schedule changes effective August 30, 2009| publisher = [[TriMet]]| url = http://www.trimet.org/alerts/190-maxyellowline-sept09.htm| date = August 29, 2009| accessdate = October 1, 2009}}</ref>  In 2015, the Yellow Line became through-routed at all times with the then-new [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]] (see below). 
* The [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]] runs from [[Clackamas Town Center]], in the [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]] area, north along [[Interstate 205 (Oregon-Washington)|I-205]] for 6.5 miles (10.5&nbsp;km) to the Gateway Transit Center, where the Blue and Red Lines meet. From Gateway, it joins them and travels westwards to downtown Portland along the 1986-opened tracks extending to the [[Steel Bridge]]. From there—a new junction on the bridge's west deck—the Green Line uses 1.8 miles (2.9&nbsp;km) of new tracks passing [[Portland Union Station|Union Station]] and running mainly along the transit mall for the remainder of its route through downtown, sharing that routing with the Yellow Line (and since 2015 the Orange Line) and terminating at [[Portland State University]] (PSU).<ref name="riderspack"/>  
*The [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]] added {{convert|7.3|mi|km|adj=off}} of newly constructed line, extending from the south end of the Portland Mall to [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]. The project included construction of the [[Tilikum Crossing]], the first new bridge opened across the [[Willamette River]] in Portland in 42 years (since 1973),<ref name=popular-mechanics>{{cite magazine|last=Newcomb|first=Tim|title=Portland Is Set To Open a Beautiful $135 Million Bridge You Can't Drive Across|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/g2136/portland-tillikum-crossing-bridge-no-cars/|date=August 20, 2015|magazine=[[Popular Mechanics]]|accessdate=February 24, 2016}}</ref> which is also notable for being open only to transit vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists—and not private vehicles.<ref name=popular-mechanics/><ref name=Libby2015>{{Cite journal |last=Libby |first=Brian |date=October 2015 |title=Bridge to the Future (The Bridge that Bans Cars) |journal=[[The Atlantic]] |publisher= |volume=316 |issue=3 |pages=42–43 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/10/the-bridge-that-bans-cars/403234/ |accessdate=September 27, 2015 }}</ref>  From the PSU area in downtown, the Orange Line follows streets and a bus-and-light-rail-only viaduct to reach the [[South Waterfront]] district. After crossing the river, the line turns southward, passing through Southeast Portland along a new median on SE 17th Avenue and then mostly along or adjacent to previously existing railroad [[right-of-way (transportation)|rights-of-way]] to downtown Milwaukie.  The terminal station is at Park Avenue, just south of downtown Milwaukie. Operationally, it is linked to the Yellow Line at all times; southbound Yellow Line trains become Orange Line trains when they depart from Rose Quarter TC, and northbound Orange Line trains become Yellow Line trains when they reach the transit mall in downtown Portland.

===Portland Streetcar===
[[File:PortlandStreetcar5.jpg|thumb|right|Portland Streetcar]]
{{main|Portland Streetcar}}

The [[Portland Streetcar]] is a two-line [[streetcar]] system serving the central part of Portland—[[Downtown Portland|downtown]] and the areas immediately surrounding downtown.

Originally named the [[Central Loop (Portland Streetcar)|Central Loop]] Line, or CL Line, it was renamed the A Loop (clockwise) and B Loop (counterclockwise) in 2015, when it was extended from the eastside across the Tilikum Crossing bridge and also along the NS Line from South Waterfront to Portland State University.

===Commuter rail===
TriMet's [[WES Commuter Rail]] connects the cities of [[Wilsonville, Oregon|Wilsonville]], [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]], [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] and [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]].  It is one of only three suburb-to-suburb [[commuter rail]] lines in the country,{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} along with [[Tri-Rail]] in [[Miami]] and the [[Inland Empire-Orange County Line]] operated by [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]] between San Bernardino and Oceanside, Calif.  Rather than electric railcars like those of MAX, the line uses [[Federal Railroad Administration|FRA]]-compliant [[diesel multiple unit]]s running on existing [[Portland and Western Railroad]] freight tracks.  The first rides open to the general public took place on Friday, January 30, 2009, and regular service began on Monday, February 2, 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://portlandtribune.com/component/content/article?id=44156 |title=WES' first day&nbsp;— 'I plan on using it every day' |author=Leah Weissman |newspaper=[[Beaverton Valley Times]]|date=February 5, 2009 <!--(later redated Feb. 4 by the publisher)-->| accessdate=November 19, 2015}}</ref>

[[Amtrak]] also exists as a rail commuting option in the Portland area with the [[Amtrak Cascades]] providing daily service between Portland and neighboring Oregon City.<ref>http://amtrakcascades.com/Schedules.htm</ref> While the frequency is less than that of [[TriMet]], the 20-minute ride from Oregon City is faster, has cheaper tickets, and is arguably a more comfortable service.<ref>http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2012/03/amtrak_gaining_popularity_amon.html</ref>

Many streets in Portland are one-way; streets in downtown Portland (Southwest Portland bounded by I-405 and the Willamette River) are virtually all one-way, forming a grid of alternating street traffic: for north-south streets, odd-numbered avenues (1st, 3rd, etc.) are southbound, while even-numbered avenues (2nd, 4th, etc.) are northbound, and similarly east-west streets alternate.  This is partly due to the streets in downtown Portland being relatively narrow ({{convert|64|ft}}).{{Clarify| question=how does narrow streets relate to alternating direction of travel?|date=February 2012}} This grid extends a short way west across I-405 into [[Goose Hollow, Portland, Oregon|Goose Hollow]], terminating at SW 18th Avenue, and extends to some degree north across Burnside into the Pearl District, particularly with the north-south streets extending into Old Town.

Most streets on the east side are two-way, but there are a number of [[one-way pair]]s along major routes:  Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. (MLK)/Grand Avenue (the equivalent of 4th and 5th avenues), and 11th/12th east-west pairs are connected with bridges, with NE Couch/Burnside forming a pair east of the Burnside Bridge from 3rd to 14th avenues, SE Morrison/SE Belmont forming a pair from the [[Morrison Bridge]] to SE 25th Ave, and SE Madison/SE Hawthorne forming a pair from the [[Hawthorne Bridge]] to SE 12th Avenue.

==Airports==
Portland's main airport is the [[Portland International Airport]] {{airport codes|PDX|KPDX}}, located in the northeast quadrant, near the [[Columbia River]], and 20 minutes by car from downtown. PDX is also connected to the downtown business and arts districts by the MAX Red Line. The city's first airport, [[Swan Island Municipal Airport]], opened in  1927 and closed in the 1940s.

The Port of Portland's [[Hillsboro Airport]] {{airport codes|HIO|KHIO}} is an executive and [[general aviation]] airport located in [[Hillsboro, Oregon]], and it the second busiest airport in the state. It is connected to the metropolitan area by the MAX Blue Line, and is the starting point for many corporate and charter flights, including [[Nike, Inc.]].
