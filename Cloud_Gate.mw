'''''Cloud Gate''''' is a [[public art|public]] sculpture by [[India]]n-born British artist [[Sir Anish Kapoor]], that is the centerpiece of [[AT&T Plaza]] at [[Millennium Park]] in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. The sculpture and AT&T Plaza are located on top of [[Park Grill]], between the [[Chase Promenade]] and [[McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink]]. Constructed between 2004 and 2006, the sculpture is nicknamed '''The Bean''' because of its shape. Made up of 168 [[stainless steel]] plates welded together, its highly polished exterior has no visible seams. It measures {{convert|33|by|66|by|42|ft|m}}, and weighs {{convert|110|ST|t LT|0|sp=us}}.

Kapoor's design was inspired by liquid [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and the sculpture's surface reflects and distorts the city's skyline. Visitors are able to walk around and under Cloud Gate's {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} high arch. On the underside is the "omphalos" (Greek for "navel"), a concave chamber that warps and multiplies reflections. The sculpture builds upon many of Kapoor's artistic [[Theme (visual arts)|theme]]s, and it is popular with tourists as a photo-taking opportunity for its unique reflective properties.

The sculpture was the result of a design competition. After Kapoor's design was chosen, numerous technological concerns regarding the design's construction and assembly arose, in addition to concerns regarding the sculpture's upkeep and maintenance. Various experts were consulted, some of whom believed the design could not be implemented. Eventually, a feasible method was found, but the sculpture's construction fell behind schedule. It was unveiled in an incomplete form during the Millennium Park grand opening celebration in 2004, before being concealed again while it was completed. ''Cloud Gate'' was formally dedicated on May 15, 2006, and has since gained considerable popularity, both domestically and internationally.

Lying between [[Lake Michigan]] to the east and the Loop to the west, [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] has been Chicago's front yard since the mid-19th century. Its northwest corner, north of Monroe Street and the [[Art Institute of Chicago|Art Institute]], east of [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]], south of [[Randolph Street (Chicago)|Randolph Street]], and west of [[Columbus Drive (Chicago)|Columbus Drive]], had been [[Illinois Central Railroad|Illinois Central]] rail yards and parking lots until 1997, when it was made available for development by the city as [[Millennium Park]].<ref name=MPNYT>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/books/chapters/0806-1st-gilf.html|title=Millennium Park|accessdate=June 24, 2008|date=August 6, 2006|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Gilfoyle, Timothy J.}}</ref> For 2007, the park was Chicago's second largest tourist attraction, trailing only [[Navy Pier]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Crain's List Largest Tourist Attractions (Sightseeing): Ranked by 2007 attendance|date=June 23, 2008|page=22|publisher=[[Crain Communications Inc.]]|work=Crain's Chicago Business}}</ref>

In 1999, Millennium Park officials and a group of [[art collector]]s, [[curator]]s and [[architect]]s reviewed the artistic works of 30&nbsp;different artists and asked two for proposals.

Although Kapoor does not draw with computers, computer modeling was essential to the process of analyzing the complex form,<ref>Baume, p. 53</ref> which created numerous issues. Since the sculpture was expected to be outdoors, concerns arose that it might retain and conduct heat in a way that would make it too hot to touch during the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to it during the winter. The extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared to weaken the structure. [[Graffiti]], bird droppings and [[fingerprint]]s were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface.<ref name="BghcbAAKabsbaoCGaMdciMP" /><ref name="G202" /> The most pressing issue was the need to create a single [[Seam (metallurgy)|seamless]] exterior for the external shell, a feat architect [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] once believed to be nearly impossible.<ref name="G202">Gilfoyle, p. 202.</ref>

While the sculpture was being constructed, public and media outlets nicknamed it "The Bean" because of its shape, a name that Kapoor described as "completely stupid".<ref name="location"/> Months later, Kapoor officially named the piece "Cloud Gate".<ref name="AABSBDBA">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E2D61F3BF93BA25754C0A9629C8B63|title= Art/Architecture; Big Shoulders, Big Donors, Big Art|accessdate=June 1, 2008|date=July 18, 2004|author=Bernstein, Fred A.|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Critical reviews describe the sculpture as a passage between realms.<ref name=B123>Baume, pp. 123&ndash;132</ref> Three-quarters of the sculpture's external surface reflects the sky and the name refers to it acting as a type of gate that helps bridge the space between the sky and the viewer.<ref>Gilfoyle, pp. 263‚Äì4</ref> The sculpture and plaza are sometimes referred to jointly as "''Cloud Gate'' on the AT&T Plaza".<ref name="millennium"/><!-- <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/features/07/09/travel.log.chicagoland/index.html|title=Travel Log: Chicagoland: Big city, suburbs no stranger to greenspace for visitors|accessdate=October 27, 2008|date=July 9, 2008|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|work=NASCAR.com|author=Pate, Josh}}</ref> --> It is Kapoor's first public outdoor work in the United States,<ref name="millennium"/> and is the work by which he is best known in the country according to the ''[[Financial Times]]''.<ref name="Iao" />

==Construction and maintenance==
[[Image:Cloud gate construction.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A crane lifts a large, oval-shaped ring in front of several large buildings|The first of two internal support rings for the sculpture is erected in [[Millennium Park]] at [[AT&T Plaza]].]]

The British engineering firm [[Atelier One]] and freelance engineer Chris Hornzee-Jones (who later went on to form the engineering firm Aerotrope in 2005) provided the sculpture's structural design,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Liquid Threshold|author1=Thomas, Neil  |author2=Chadwick, Aran|publisher=Atelier One|year=2009|isbn=978-0-9562563-0-0}}</ref><ref name="Aerotrope">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerotrope.com/profile.html|title=aerotrope profile|accessdate=February 19, 2010|publisher=[[Aerotrope]]}}</ref> and Performance Structures, Inc. (PSI) was chosen to [[fabrication (metal)|fabricate]] it because of their ability to produce nearly invisible [[welding|welds]].<ref name="findarticle"/> The project began with PSI attempting to recreate the design in miniature. A high-density [[polyurethane]] foam model was selected by Kapoor, which was then used to design the final structure, including the interior structural components.<ref name="construction">{{Cite web|url=http://midwest.construction.com/features/archive/0410_feature7-2.asp |accessdate=May 31, 2008 |title=Special Project ‚Äì Chicago's Millennium Park Project |work=[[McGraw-Hill Construction]] |author=Steele, Jeffrey}}</ref> Initially, PSI planned to build and assemble the sculpture in [[Oakland, California]], and ship it to Chicago through the [[Panama Canal]] and [[St. Lawrence Seaway]]. However, this plan was discarded after park officials deemed it too risky, so the decision was made to transport the individual panels by truck and to assemble the structure on-site, a task undertaken by MTH Industries.<ref name="findarticle">{{cite journal|author=Schulze, Franz|date=November 2004|title=Sunday afternoon in the Cyber-Age Park: the city's new greensward features Frank Gehny's latest, plus "interactive" sculptural works by Jaume Plensa and Anish Kapoor |work=Art in America|pages=66‚Äì69}}</ref><ref name="construction"/><ref name=S55>Sharoff, p. 55.</ref>

The sculpture's weight raised concerns. Estimating the thickness of the steel needed to create the sculpture's desired aesthetics before fabrication was difficult.<ref name="G165">Gilfoyle, p. 165.</ref> ''Cloud Gate'' was originally estimated to weigh {{convert|60|ST|t LT|0|sp=us}} when completed.<ref>Gilfoyle, p. 402.</ref> However, the final figure was almost twice as heavy at {{convert|110|ST|t LT|0|sp=us}}. This extra weight required engineers to reconsider the sculpture's supporting structures. The roof of the [[Park Grill]], upon which ''Cloud Gate'' sits, had to be built strong enough to bear the weight. The large retaining wall separating Chicago's [[Metra]] train tracks from the North [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]] garage supports much of the weight of the sculpture and forms the back side of the restaurant. This wall, along with the rest of the garage's foundation, required additional bracing before the piece was erected.<ref name="G165" /> ''Cloud Gate'' is further [[buttress]]ed by lateral members underneath the plaza that are anchored to the sculpture's interior structure by [[tie rod]]s.<ref name="construction"/>

Inside ''Cloud Gate''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s polished exterior shell are several steel structures that keep the sculpture standing. The first structural pieces, two [[Stainless steel#Stainless steel grades|type 304 stainless steel]] rings, were put into place in February 2004. As construction continued, crisscrossing pipe [[truss]]es were assembled between the two rings.<ref name="usglass">{{cite journal|url=http://www.usglassmag.com/USGlass/2007/April/AGGmetalgleam.htm |volume=42 |issue=4 |accessdate=June 2, 2008 |title=Making Metal Gleam |journal=USGlass |date=April 2007}}</ref> The trusses and supporting structures were only present for the construction phases. The finished sculpture has no inner bracing.<ref>Sharoff, p. 51</ref> The supporting structural components were designed and constructed to ensure that no specific point was overloaded, and to avoid producing unwanted indentations on the exterior shell. The frame was also designed to expand and contract with the sculpture as temperatures fluctuate. As a result, the two large rings supporting the sculpture move independently of each other, allowing the shell to move independently of the rings.<ref name="construction"/>

When ''Cloud Gate'''s interior components were completed, construction crews prepared to work on the outer shell; this comprises 168&nbsp;stainless steel panels, each {{convert|3/8|in|mm|0}} thick and weighing {{convert|1000|to|2000|lb|kg|lk=on}}.<ref name="polish"/> They were fabricated using three-dimensional modeling software.<ref name="construction"/> Computers and robots were essential in the bending and shaping of the plates,<ref name=S55/> which was performed by [[English wheel]] and a robotic scanning device.<ref>Sharoff, p. 56</ref> Metal stiffeners were welded to each panel's interior face to provide a small degree of rigidity. About a third of the plates, along with the entire interior structure, were fabricated in Oakland.<ref name="construction"/> The plates were polished to 98&nbsp;percent of their final state and covered with protective white film before being sent to Chicago via trucks.<ref name="G204" /> Once in Chicago, the plates were welded together on-site, creating 2,442&nbsp;linear feet (744&nbsp;m) of welded seams.<ref name="polish">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/chi-0508240314aug24,0,1725342.story |accessdate=June 3, 2008 |date=August 24, 2005 |title=Making it shine |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |author=Nunn, Emily}}</ref> Welders used [[Laser-hybrid welding|keyhole welding machines]] rather than traditional welding guns.<ref name="Sharoff, p. 61"/> The plates were fabricated so precisely that no on-site cutting or filing was necessary when lifting and fitting them into position.<ref name="polish"/>

When construction of the shell began in June 2004, a large tent was erected around the piece to shield it from public view.<ref name="photoessay">{{Cite web |url=http://www.lynnbecker.com/repeat/Gehry/kapoor.htm |accessdate=May 31, 2008 |title=A photo essay on the making of Anish Kapoor's Cloud Gate sculpture in Chicago's Millennium Park |work=Repeat |author=Becker, Lynn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602021642/http://www.lynnbecker.com/repeat/Gehry/kapoor.htm |archivedate=June 2, 2008 |df= }}</ref> Construction began with the omphalos, where plates were attached to the supporting internal steel structure, from the inside (underside) of the sculpture downward to the outermost surfaces.<ref name="G204">Gilfoyle, p. 204.</ref> This sequence caused the structure to resemble a large [[sombrero]] when the bottom was complete.<ref name="G206">Gilfoyle, p. 206.</ref>

The shell of ''Cloud Gate'' was fully erected for the grand opening of Millennium Park on July 15, 2004, although it was unpolished and thus unfinished, because its assembly had fallen behind schedule. The piece was temporarily uncovered on July 8 for the opening, although Kapoor was unhappy with this as it allowed the public to see the sculpture in an unfinished state.<ref name="CAI">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagoarchitecture.info/Building/636/Cloud_Gate.php |accessdate=June 1, 2008 |title=Cloud Gate |work=Chicago Architecture Info}}</ref> The original plan was to re-erect the tent around the sculpture for polishing on July 24, but public appreciation for the piece convinced park officials to leave it uncovered for several months.

The city first set a policy of collecting permit fees for photographs. These permits were initially set at $350 per day for professional still photographers, $1,200 per day for professional [[videographer]]s and $50 per hour for wedding photographers.

In addition to restricting photography of public art, closing a public park for a private event has also been controversial. In 2005 and 2006, almost all of Millennium Park was closed for a day for corporate events. On both occasions, as one of the park's primary attractions, ''Cloud Gate'' was the focus of controversy. On September 8, 2005, [[Toyota Motor Sales USA]] paid $800,000 to rent most venues in the park including ''Cloud Gate'' on AT&T Plaza from 6&nbsp;a.m. to 11&nbsp;p.m.<ref name="NWITP">{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10C8591BB16FF1E0&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=No Walk In The Park ‚Äì Toyota VIPs receive Millennium Park 's red-carpet treatment; everyone else told to just keep on going |accessdate=July 26, 2008|date=September 9, 2005|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Ahmed-Ullah, Noreen S.}}</ref><ref name="TS8NBFY">{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=109EF4F4D7BED508&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=This Sept. 8, No Bean For You ‚Äì Unless you're a Toyota dealer.

==Artistic themes==

===Relevant Kapoor themes===
{{Quote box
 | quote  = I hope what I have done is make a serious work, which deals with serious questions about form, public space and an object in space.

[[Anish Kapoor]] has a reputation for creating spectacles in urban settings by producing works of extreme size and scale.<ref name="Iao">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/89e6e5fe-39ab-11dd-90d7-0000779fd2ac.html?|title=Innies and outies|accessdate=July 31, 2008|date=June 14, 2008|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|work=[[The Financial Times]]|author=Budick, Ariella}}</ref> Before creating ''Cloud Gate'', Kapoor had created art that distorted images of the viewer instead of portraying images of its own. In so doing, he acquired experience blurring the boundary between the limit and the limitless.<ref name="G267">Gilfoyle, p. 267.</ref> Kapoor drew on past experience to design ''Cloud Gate'', in particular the designing of ''[[Sky Mirror]]'' (2001), a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} {{convert|10|ST|t LT|0|adj=on|sp=us}} concave stainless steel mirror that also used a theme of distorted perception on a grand scale.<ref name="G267" />

Kapoor's objects often aim to evoke immateriality and the spiritual, an outcome he achieves either by carving dark voids into stone pieces, or more recently, through the sheer shine and reflectivity of his objects.<ref name="AMPAPaNYI" /> This Indian artist's works have no fixed identity, but rather occupy an illusionary space that is consistent with eastern theologies shared by [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Taoism]], as well as [[Albert Einstein]]'s views of a non-three-dimensional world.<ref name=B123/> Kapoor explores the theme of ambiguity with his works that place the viewer in a state of "in-betweenness".<ref name="G264" /> The artist often questions and plays with such dualities as solidity&ndash;emptiness or reality&ndash;reflection, which in turn allude to such paired opposites as flesh&ndash;spirit, the here&ndash;the beyond, east&ndash;west, sky&ndash;earth, etc. that create the conflict between internal and external, superficial and subterranean, and conscious and unconscious.<ref name="G265" /> Kapoor also creates a tension between masculine and feminine within his art by having concave points of focus that invite the entry of visitors and multiplies their images when they are positioned correctly.<ref name="G265" /><ref name="G271">Gilfoyle, pp. 271‚Äì2.</ref>

===''Cloud Gate'' themes===
Kapoor often speaks of removing both the signature of the artist from his works as well as any traces of their fabrication, or what he refers to as "traces of the hand".<ref name=B123/><ref name="AMPAPaNYI" /> He aspires to make his works look like they have independent realities that he reveals rather than creates.<ref name=B123/> For him, removing all the seams from ''Cloud Gate'' was necessary in order to make the sculpture seem as though it was "perfect" and ready-made. These effects increase the viewer's fascination with it and makes them wonder what it is and where it came from.<ref name="SaM" /> His attempts to hide his works' seams as an artist stand in contrast to [[Frank Gehry]]'s architectural designs in the park, [[Jay Pritzker Pavilion]] and [[BP Pedestrian Bridge]], which display their seams prominently.<ref name="AABSBDBA" />

[[File:Cloud Gate boy reflection.jpg|alt=A boy stands vertically with his head touching the mirror-like surface of an object; his reflection in the object appears horizontal|thumb|left|upright|A boy and his reflection at ''Cloud Gate'']]

''Cloud Gate'' is described as a transformative, iconic work.<ref>Baume, p. 9</ref> It is similar to many of Kapoor's previous works in the themes and issues it addresses. While the sculpture's mirror effects are reminiscent of fun-house fairground mirrors, they also have a more serious intent; they help dematerialize this very large object, making it seem light and almost weightless.<ref name="AKPPF">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1812056,00.html|title=Anish Kapoor: Past, Present, Future|accessdate=July 6, 2008|date=June 5, 2008|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Lacayo, Richard}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,995369,00.html|title=Windy City Redux|accessdate=June 3, 2008|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Roston, Eric|date=October 11, 2004}}</ref> ''Cloud Gate'' is considered Kapoor's most ambitious use of complex mirrored form dynamics.<ref name=B18>Baume, p. 18</ref> Kapoor challenges his viewers to internalize his work through intellectual and theoretical exercise. By reflecting the sky, visiting and non-visiting pedestrians and surrounding architecture, ''Cloud Gate'' limits its viewers to partial comprehension at any time. The interaction with the viewer who moves to create his own vision gives it a spiritual dimension.<ref name="G264">Gilfoyle, p. 264.</ref> The sculpture is described as a disembodied, luminous form,<ref name="G264" /> which is also how his earlier ''1000 Names'' (1979&ndash;80) was described when it addressed the metaphysical and mystical.<ref name="G265">Gilfoyle, p. 265.</ref>

The viewer physically enters the art when he walks underneath it into its "navel". The omphalos is a "warped dimension of fluid space". In this dimension, solid is transformed into fluid in a disorienting multiplicative manner that intensifies the experience. It is emblematic of Kapoor's work to deconstruct empirical space and venture into [[manifold]] possibilities of [[abstract space]].<ref name=B18/> The experience is described as a displaced or virtual depth that is composed of multiplied surfaces.<ref>Baume, p. 26</ref>

According to project manager Lou Cerny of MTH Industries, "When the light is right, you can't see where the sculpture ends and the sky begins."<ref>Sharoff, p. 45</ref> The sculpture challenges perception by distorting and deforming the surrounding architecture.<ref name=J120>Jodidio, pp. 120‚Äì122</ref> The [[skyscraper]]s along East [[Randolph Street]] to the northeast ([[Two Prudential Plaza]], and [[Aon Center (Chicago)|Aon Center]]), north ([[One Prudential Plaza]]) and northwest ([[The Heritage at Millennium Park|The Heritage]], [[Crain Communications Building]]) are reflected on ''Cloud Gate'''s surface when viewed from either the east or the west. The sculpture also warps viewers' perception of time by changing the speed of movements such as the passing of clouds.<ref name=J120/>

Although in the conventional sense ''Cloud Gate'' is not an opening that leads anywhere in the same way that monumental gates do, it frames a view and is celebratory in the way it creates a ceremonial place.  The work is credited with achieving a new level or understanding described as a [[transubstantiation]] of material, reminiscent of that which the artist experienced during a 1979 trip to India. Kapoor's ''1000 Names'' evolved immediately after this trip; twenty-five years later he created ''Cloud Gate'', an object that emerged from material forms to become immaterial.<ref name=B123/>

Kapoor often relies on tenets of Hinduism in his art and says that "The experience of opposites allows for the expression of wholeness."<ref name=B123/> Primal dualities that are one, such as the [[lingam]] and [[yoni]], are important to Indian culture, and ''Cloud Gate'' represents both the male and female in one entity by symbolizing both the [[vagina]] and [[testicle]]s.<ref name=B123/> Thus, it represents the tension between the masculine and the feminine.

==In popular culture==
The sculpture has been used as a backdrop in commercial films, notably in the 2006 Hollywood film ''[[The Break-Up]]'', which had to reshoot several scenes because the sculpture was under cover for the initial filming.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=110AF1D246501AA8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2|title=Vaughn, Aniston frolic under Cloud cover|accessdate=July 31, 2008|date=March 30, 2006|publisher=Newsbank|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Zwecker, Bill}}</ref> It is also prominently featured in the ending scene of ''[[Source Code]]''.
