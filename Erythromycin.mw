== Adverse effects ==

Gastrointestinal disturbances, such as [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]], [[abdominal pain]], and [[vomiting]], are very common because erythromycin is a [[motilin]] agonist.<ref name="pmid8470625">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weber FH, Richards RD, McCallum RW | title = Erythromycin: a motilin agonist and gastrointestinal prokinetic agent | journal = The American Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 88 | issue = 4 | pages = 485–90 | date = Apr 1993 | pmid = 8470625 | doi =  }}</ref> Because of this, erythromycin tends not to be prescribed as a first-line drug.  It may be useful in treating [[gastroparesis]] due to this promotility effect.  Intravenous erythromycin may also be used in [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy|endoscopy]] as an adjunct to clear [[stomach|gastric]] contents.

More serious side effects include  [[arrhythmia]] with [[prolonged QT interval]]s including ''[[torsades de pointes]]'', and reversible [[deafness]]. Allergic reactions range from [[urticaria]] to [[anaphylaxis]].  [[Cholestasis]], [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]], and [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] are some other rare side effects that may occur.

Studies have shown evidence both for and against the association of pyloric stenosis and exposure to erythromycin prenatally and postnatally.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/patch_f/1831759#f_pregnancy-and-lactation | title = Pregnancy and lactation }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/74/304361 | title = unknown }}</ref> Exposure to erythromycin (especially long courses at antimicrobial doses, and also through [[breastfeeding]]) has been linked to an increased probability of [[pyloric stenosis]] in young infants.<ref name="pmid17337692">{{cite journal | author = Maheshwai N | title = Are young infants treated with erythromycin at risk for developing hypertrophic pyloric stenosis? | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 92 | issue = 3 | pages = 271–3 | date = Mar 2007 | pmid = 17337692 | pmc = 2083424 | doi = 10.1136/adc.2006.110007 | url = http://adc.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17337692 }}</ref><ref name="pmid24618148">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lund M, Pasternak B, Davidsen RB, Feenstra B, Krogh C, Diaz LJ, Wohlfahrt J, Melbye M | title = Use of macrolides in mother and child and risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: nationwide cohort study | journal = BMJ | volume = 348 | issue = | pages = g1908 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24618148 | pmc = 3949411 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.g1908 }}</ref> Erythromycin used for feeding intolerance in young infants has not been associated with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.<ref name="pmid17337692"/>

It can also affect the central nervous system, causing psychotic reactions, nightmares and night sweats.<ref name="BCFI"/>

It may also alter the effectiveness of [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s because of its effect on the gut flora. Erythromycin is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 system, which means it can have a rapid effect on levels of other drugs metabolised by this system, e.g., warfarin.

== Interactions ==

Erythromycin is metabolized by enzymes of the [[cytochrome P450]] system, in particular, by [[isozymes]] of the [[CYP3A]] superfamily, CYP3A.<ref name="pmid1732074">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hunt CM, Watkins PB, Saenger P, Stave GM, Barlascini N, Watlington CO, Wright JT, Guzelian PS | title = Heterogeneity of CYP3A isoforms metabolizing erythromycin and cortisol | journal = Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 18–23 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1732074 | doi = 10.1038/clpt.1992.3}}</ref> The activity of the CYP3A enzymes can be induced or inhibited by certain drugs (e.g. dexamethasone) which can cause it to affect the [[metabolism]] of many different drugs, e.g. erythromycin. If other CYP3A substrates — drugs that are broken down by CYP3A — such as [[simvastatin]] (Zocor), [[lovastatin]] (Mevacor), or [[atorvastatin]] (Lipitor)—are taken concomitantly with erythromycin, levels of the substrates increase, often causing adverse effects. A noted drug interaction involves erythromycin and simvastatin, resulting in increased simvastatin levels and the potential for [[rhabdomyolysis]]. Another group of CYP3A4 substrates are drugs used for [[migraine]] such as [[ergotamine]] and [[dihydroergotamine]]; their adverse effects may be more pronounced if erythromycin is associated.<ref name="BCFI">{{cite web | url = http://www.bcfi.be/GGR/MPG/MPG_KABA.cfm | title = Erythromycine | work = Belgisch Centrum voor Farmacotherapeutische Informatie }}</ref>
Earlier case reports on sudden death prompted a study on a large cohort that confirmed a link between erythromycin, [[ventricular tachycardia]], and sudden cardiac death in patients also taking drugs that prolong the metabolism of erythromycin (like [[verapamil]] or [[diltiazem]]) by interfering with CYP3A4.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ray WA, Murray KT, Meredith S, Narasimhulu SS, Hall K, Stein CM | title = Oral erythromycin and the risk of sudden death from cardiac causes | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 351 | issue = 11 | pages = 1089–96 | date = Sep 2004 | pmid = 15356306 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa040582 }}</ref> Hence, erythromycin should not be administered to people using these drugs, or drugs that also prolong the [[QT interval]]. Other examples include [[terfenadine]] (Seldane, Seldane-D), [[astemizole]] (Hismanal), [[cisapride]] (Propulsid, withdrawn in many countries for prolonging the QT time) and [[pimozide]] (Orap). [[Theophylline]], which is used mostly in asthma, is also contraindicated.

Erythromycin may affect neuromuscular transmission by acting presynaptically, so may produce or worsen symptoms of [[myasthenia gravis]] in patients with pre-existing postsynaptic defects.  Exacerbations of myasthenia gravis have also been reported with the use of telithromycin and azithromycin.<ref>{{cite web | title = Drugs Which May Exacerbate or Induce Myasthenia Gravis: A Clinician's Guide | url = http://ispub.com/IJN/10/2/9809}}</ref>

Erythromycin and [[doxycycline]] can have a synergistic effect when combined and kill bacteria (''E. coli)'' with a higher potency than the sum of the two drugs together. This synergistic relationship is only temporary. After approximately 72 hours, the relationship shifts to become antagonistic, whereby a 50/50 combination of the two drugs kills less bacteria than if the two drugs were administered separately.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pena-Miller R, Laehnemann D, Jansen G, Fuentes-Hernandez A, Rosenstiel P, Schulenburg H, Beardmore R | title = When the most potent combination of antibiotics selects for the greatest bacterial load: the smile-frown transition | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = e1001540 | date = April 23, 2013 | pmid = 23630452 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001540 | pmc=3635860}}</ref>

== Pharmacology ==

=== Mechanism of action ===

Erythromycin displays [[bacteriostatic]] activity or inhibits growth of bacteria, especially at higher concentrations,<ref name="ReferenceA">Katzung PHARMACOLOGY, 9e Section VIII. Chemotherapeutic Drugs Chapter 44. Chloramphenicol, Tetracyclines, Macrolides, Clindamycin, & Streptogramins</ref> but the mechanism is not fully understood. By binding to the 50s subunit of the bacterial  [[rRNA]] complex, protein synthesis and subsequent structure and function processes critical for life or replication are inhibited.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Erythromycin interferes with aminoacyl translocation, preventing the transfer of the [[tRNA]] bound at the [[A site]] of the rRNA complex to the [[P site]] of the rRNA complex. Without this translocation, the A site remains occupied, thus the addition of an incoming tRNA and its attached [[amino acid]] to the nascent [[polypeptide]] chain is inhibited. This interferes with the production of functionally useful proteins, which is the basis of this antimicrobial action.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===

Erythromycin is easily inactivated by gastric acid; therefore, all orally administered formulations are given as either enteric-coated or more-stable salts or [[ester]]s, such as erythromycin [[succinate|ethylsuccinate]]. Erythromycin is very rapidly absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and [[phagocyte]]s. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, erythromycin is actively transported to the site of infection, where, during active [[phagocytosis]], large concentrations of erythromycin are released.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

=== Metabolism ===

Most of erythromycin is metabolised by [[demethylation]] in the [[liver]] by the hepatic enzyme CYP3A4. Its main elimination route is in the [[bile]] with little renal excretion, 2%-15% unchanged drug. Erythromycin's [[elimination half-life]] ranges between 1.5 and 2.0 hours and is between 5 and 6 hours in patients with end-stage renal disease.  Erythromycin levels peak in the serum 4 hours after dosing; ethylsuccinate peaks 0.5-2.5 hours after dosing, but can be delayed if digested with food.<ref name="online.lexi.com">{{cite web | url = http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/74/304361#pkm | title = unknown }}</ref>

Erythromycin crosses the placenta and enters breast milk.  The American Association of Pediatrics determined erythromycin is safe to take while breastfeeding.<ref name="urlwww.breastfeedingmadesimple.com">{{cite journal | vauthors = | title = Transfer of drugs and other chemicals into human milk | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | pages = 776–89 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11533352 | doi = | url =  http://www.breastfeedingmadesimple.com/AAPDrugsinMilk.pdf }}</ref> Absorption in pregnant patients has been shown to be variable, frequently resulting in levels lower than in nonpregnant patients.<ref name="online.lexi.com"/>

== Chemistry ==

=== Composition ===

Standard-grade erythromycin is primarily composed of four related compounds known as erythromycins A, B, C, and D. Each of these compounds can be present in varying amounts and can differ by lot. Erythromycin A has been found to have the most antibacterial activity, followed by erythromycin B. Erythromycins C and D are about half as active as erythromycin A.<ref name = "www.toku-e.com"/><ref name="pmid4091529">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kibwage IO, Hoogmartens J, Roets E, Vanderhaeghe H, Verbist L, Dubost M, Pascal C, Petitjean P, Levol G | title = Antibacterial activities of erythromycins A, B, C, and D and some of their derivatives | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 630–3 | date = Nov 1985 | pmid = 4091529 | pmc = 176346 | doi =  10.1128/aac.28.5.630}}</ref> Some of these related compounds have been purified and can be studied and researched individually.

=== Synthesis ===

Over the three decades after the discovery of erythromycin A and its activity as an antimicrobial, many attempts were  made to synthesize it in the laboratory. The presence of 10 stereospecific carbons and several points of distinct substitution has made the total synthesis of erythromycin A a formidable task.<ref>{{cite journal | authors = Pal S | year = 2006 | title = A journey across the sequential development of macrolides and ketolides related to erythromycin | journal = Tetrahedron | volume = 62 | issue = 14| pages = 3171–3200 | doi = 10.1016/j.tet.2005.11.064 }}</ref> Complete syntheses of erythromycins’ related structures and precursors such as 6-deoxyerythronolide B have been accomplished, giving way to possible syntheses of different erythromycins and other macrolide antimicrobials.<ref>{{cite journal | authors = Evans DA, Kim AS | year = 1997 | title = Synthesis of 6-Deoxyerythronolide B.

== History ==

Erythromycin was discovered by [[Abelardo Aguilar]] when working for the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Company as a researcher.<ref>Hibionada, F. Remembering the battle of Dr. Abelardo Aguilar: Cure for millions, deprived of millions.The News Today. Retrieved 22 September 2015</ref> 

In 1949 Abelardo B. Aguilar, a Filipino scientist, sent some soil samples to his employer [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] . Eli Lilly’s research team, led by J. M. McGuire, managed to isolate erythromycin from the metabolic products of a strain of ''[[Saccharopolyspora erythraea|Streptomyces erythreus]]'' (designation changed to "''Saccharopolyspora erythraea''") found in the samples.

Lilly filed for patent protection of the compound and U.S. patent 2,653,899 was granted in 1953. The product was launched commercially in 1952 under the brand name Ilosone (after the [[Philippines|Philippine]] region of [[Iloilo Province|Iloilo]] where it was originally collected). Erythromycin was formerly also called Ilotycin.

In 1981, Nobel laureate (1965 in chemistry) and professor of chemistry at [[Harvard University]] [[Robert Burns Woodward|Robert B. Woodward]] (posthumously), along with a large number of members from his research group, reported the first stereocontrolled asymmetric chemical synthesis of erythromycin A.

The antibiotic [[clarithromycin]] was invented by scientists at the Japanese drug company [[Taisho Pharmaceutical]] in the 1970s as a result of their efforts to overcome the acid instability of erythromycin.

Scientists at [[Chugai Pharmaceuticals]] discovered an erythromycin-derived [[motilin]] agonist called [[mitemcinal]] that is believed to have strong [[prokinetic]] properties (similar to erythromycin) but lacking antibiotic properties. Erythromycin is commonly used [[off-label]] for gastric motility indications such as [[gastroparesis]]. If mitemcinal can be shown to be an effective prokinetic agent, it would represent a significant advance in the gastrointestinal field, as treatment with this drug would not carry the risk of unintentional selection for [[antibiotic-resistant bacteria]].
