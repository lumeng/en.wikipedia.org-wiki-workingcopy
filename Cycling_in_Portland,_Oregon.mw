Bicycle use in [[Portland, Oregon]] has been growing rapidly, having nearly tripled since 2001; for example, bicycle traffic on four of the Willamette River bridges has increased from 2,855 before 1992 to over 16,000 in 2008, partly due to improved facilities.<ref>[http://www.portlandonline.com/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=217489 Portland Bicycle Counts 2008] ([[PDF]]), City of Portland</ref> The [[Portland Bureau of Transportation]] says 6% of commuters [[Bicycle commuting|bike to work]] in Portland, the highest proportion of any major U.S. city and about 10 times the national average.<ref name=Weise2012>{{Citation |title= In Portland, Ore., bikes rule the road |first= Elizabeth |last= Weise |newspaper= [[USA Today]] |date= September 9, 2012 |url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-07-30/portland-oregon-biking/57722086/1 |accessdate= September 18, 2012 }}</ref>

==History==

Portland's reputation as a bike-friendly City was enhanced by The Yellow Bike Project, a 1994 civic engagement action led by local activists Tom O'Keefe and Joe Keating. O'Keefe proposed painting donated bikes – repaired by at-risk-youth served by the [[Community Cycling Center]] – bright yellow, and deploying them for free use around Portland. O'Keefe cited [[Provo_(movement)#The_White_Plans|the Provo movement's White Bicycle Plan]] in Amsterdam as inspiration after watching the documentary "[[Sex Drugs & Democracy]]".<ref name="nyt1994">{{cite news

=== Bicycle Transportation Alliance ===
{{see also|Bicycle Transportation Alliance}}
The bicycle revolution in Portland started taking off with the founding of the [[Bicycle Transportation Alliance]] in November 1990. The first project of the BTA was persuading [[TriMet]], the regional transit agency, to carry bicycles on its buses and light rail trains.  BTA gathered over 7000 signatures and the support of numerous local city councils, prompting TriMet to conduct a one-year trial on a few bus lines. After a year of no significant problems and an increase in transit ridership by cyclists, TriMet instituted the first 100% bicycle accessible major transit system in the U.S.  The Bicycle Transportation Alliance grew into one of the most effective cycling advocacy organizations in the U.S. The BTA focused on making major streets safe for cycling by advocating bicycle lanes, improvements to all seven pedestrian-accessible Willamette River bridges linking the downtown to the rest of the city and for safe, secure bicycle parking. In 1992, BTA successfully sued the City of Portland under ORS 366.514, the Oregon "Bicycle Bill," forcing the City to provide bicycle facilities as part of all projects. The City appealed this to the Oregon Court of Appeals which upheld the BTA's position, solidifying the responsibility of all governments in Oregon to provide safe bicycle and pedestrian facilities in all projects.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rex-burkholder/portlands-bicycle-revolut_b_3861490.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Portland's Bicycle Revolution Started with a Lawsuit! | date=September 4, 2013}}</ref>

==Portland Bike Plan==
Interest in city transportation planning began in the early 1970s after the state of [[Oregon]] passed [[Oregon Senate Bills 100 and 101 (1973)|comprehensive state land use laws]] with the city of Portland drafting its first 'Bicycle Master Plan' in 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibpi.usp.pdx.edu/media/portlandbikestory.pdf|title=The Portland Bicycle Story|author=Initiative for Bicycle & Pedestrian Innovation (IBPI)|publisher=[[Portland State University]]|year=2010|accessdate=2010-11-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611153037/http://www.ibpi.usp.pdx.edu/media/portlandbikestory.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-11|df=}}</ref>

===1973===
The city's first bike plan that was adopted in 1973, titled the '1973 Portland Bike Plan', called for nearly 190 miles of bicycle infrastructure to be built in the city and created a citizen's Bicycle Advisory Committee along with a Bicycle Program within the city’s Transportation Bureau.<ref name=BPHIST>{{cite web|url=http://www.bicyclelaw.com/road-rights/a.cfm/road-rights-your-city-versus-my-city|title=Road Rights- Your City Versus My City|author=Bob Mionske|publisher=BicycleLaw|date=2010-02-14|accessdate=2010-11-29}}</ref>

===1996===
By 1996, after the city had created the nearly 190 miles of initial bicycle infrastructure from the first plan, the city adopted its second bike plan in 1996, titled the 'Portland Bicycle Master Plan', which called for an additional 445 miles of bicycle infrastructure to be built over the next 20 years (cumulative of 630 miles by 2016).<ref name=BPHIST/>

===2010===
The city revised its bicycle plan again in February 2010 when the Portland City Council unanimously adopted its third bike plan, titled the 'Portland Bicycle Plan for 2030', which called for $613 million of spending on bicycle infrastructure over the next 20 years to expand the bicycle infrastructure target from 630 miles by 2016 to 962 miles by 2030 and increase the daily bicycle [[modal share]] from the current 7-8% to 25% by 2030.<ref name=BPHIST/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2010/02/portlands_2030_bicycle_plan_co.html|title=Portland's 2030 bicycle plan coasts to approval|author=Rose, Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Rose|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|date=2010-02-11|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref>  With only about 300 miles of bicycle infrastructure built by the end of 2009, the plan sets a target of building 662 miles of new bicycle infrastructure in the city over the next 20 years.<ref name=BPHIST/>

===2012===
With enabling legislation from the 2011 session, Portland lowered speed limits from {{convert|25|to|20|mph|kph}} on {{convert|70|mi|km}} of designated neighborhood greenway streets to increase safety for increasingly heavy use by pedestrians and bicyclists.<ref>{{cite web

==Bicycle infrastructure==

Portland is developing a network of [[bicycle boulevard]]s to make cycling easier and safer.  The east side of Portland is particularly well-suited for this technique due to its consistent grid of north/south and east/west streets.  The boulevards are defined with a combination of street markings, signs, and better signals for crossing busy intersections.<ref>[http://www.bta4bikes.org/at_work/bikeboulevards.php BTA: Bicycle Boulevards Campaign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112133825/http://www.bta4bikes.org/at_work/bikeboulevards.php |date=2010-11-12 }}</ref>

Another route is the [[Eastbank Esplanade|Vera Katz Eastbank Esplanade]].

In order to try to prevent car-bike crashes the city has painted sections of hazardous bike lanes blue.<ref>[http://www.portlandonline.com/transportation/index.cfm?c=34826 Blue Bike Lanes Report], City of Portland</ref>

More recently, the city has installed experimental [[Advanced stop line|bike box]]es that allow bicyclists to wait ahead of motorized traffic at red lights.<ref>[http://www.portlandonline.com/transportation/index.cfm?c=46717 Bike Boxes], City of Portland</ref>

An important milestone in Portland's [[utility cycling]] infrastructure was the expansion of the sidewalks of [[Hawthorne Bridge]] in 1997, which significantly improved the safety and ease of [[bicycle commuting]] across the [[Willamette River]].

In 2004, a bike path along the [[Sunset Highway (Oregon)|Sunset Highway]] between [[West Haven-Sylvan, Oregon|Sylvan]] and [[Cedar Hills, Oregon|Cedar Hills]] was completed, helping to link Beaverton and downtown Portland.

Bicycle access to the Morrison Bridge opened to mixed reviews in March 2010.<ref>[http://www2.co.multnomah.or.us/Public/EntryPoint?ct=5ae50e9074df7010VgnVCM1000003bc614acRCRD Morrison Bridge Bicycle & Pedestrian Improvements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717084328/http://www2.co.multnomah.or.us/Public/EntryPoint?ct=5ae50e9074df7010VgnVCM1000003bc614acRCRD |date=2011-07-17 }}, Multnomah County</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Rose|first=Joseph|title=Multnomah County opens new pedestrian, bike path across Morrison Bridge|date=March 30, 2010|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2010/03/multnomah_county_opens_new_ped.html |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://blogtown.portlandmercury.com/BlogtownPDX/archives/2010/03/30/morrison-bridge-bike-path-opens-today Morrison Bridge Bike Path Opens Today], ''[[The Portland Mercury]]''</ref>
