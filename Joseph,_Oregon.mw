'''Joseph''' is a city in [[Wallowa County, Oregon|Wallowa County]], [[Oregon]], [[United States]]. Originally named '''Silver Lake''' and '''Lake City''', the city formally named itself {{Years or months ago|1880}} in 1880 for  [[Chief Joseph]] (1840–1904) of the [[Nez Perce people]]. The population was 1,081 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

== History ==
Joseph was [[plat]]ted in 1883,<ref name="main" /> and the economy was originally based around agriculture, especially grain and stock. After a railroad line was completed to Joseph in 1908, a [[lumber mill]] opened, bolstering the economy.<ref name="main">{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Barbara Ruth|title=Main Street: Northeastern Oregon|publisher=[[Oregon Historical Society]]|year=1982|isbn=0-87595-073-6|pages=29, 30, 111}}</ref>

When the [[timber industry]] collapsed in the 1980s, local [[unemployment]] rate approached 17%. However, in 1982 a new industry was born as three [[bronze]] foundries opened in the local area.

The city sponsors the annual [[Chief Joseph Days Rodeo]] in late July,<ref name=chfjodys>{{cite web |url=http://www.chiefjosephdays.com/rodeo/ |publisher=Chief Joseph Days |title=Rodeo |accessdate=April 6, 2016}}</ref><ref name=bbcdjo>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JI9TAAAAIBAJ&sjid=n4YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4765%2C1284654 |newspaper=The Bulletin |location=Bend, Oregon |title=Chief Joseph Days |last=Hopper |first=Ila Grant |date=August 22, 1982 |page=B6 }}</ref><ref name=cjdceleb>{{cite news |url=http://www.eastoregonian.com/eo/community-news/20150714/chief-joseph-days-celebrates-70-years-of-western-heritage |newspaper=East Oregonian |location=Pendleton |title=Chief Joseph Days celebrates 70 years of Western heritage |date=July 14, 2015 |accessdate=April 6, 2016}}</ref> [[Bronze, Blues and Brews]] in August since 2001, and [[Alpenfest (Oregon)|Alpenfest]] in September, a [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-[[Bavaria]]n festival staged in Joseph and at nearby [[Wallowa Lake]].
